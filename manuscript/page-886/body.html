Beyond our hopes, and to our wish return'd! Conducted sure by Heaven! for Heaven alone Could work this wonder: welcome to thy own! And joys and happiness attend thy throne! Who knows thy bless'd, thy wish'd return? oh say, To the chaste queen shall we the news convey? Or hears she, and with blessings loads the day?"</p><p>"Dismiss that care, for to the royal bride Already is it known" (the king replied, And straight resumed his seat); while round him bows Each faithful youth, and breathes out ardent vows: Then all beneath their father take their place, Rank'd by their ages, and the banquet grace.</p></div> </div>
