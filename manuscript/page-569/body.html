<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> High in the air the tree its boughs display'd, And o'er the dungeon cast a dreadful shade; All unsustain'd between the wave and sky, Beneath my feet the whirling billows fly. What time the judge forsakes the noisy bar To take repast, and stills the wordy war, Charybdis, rumbling from her inmost caves, The mast refunded on her refluent waves. Swift from the tree, the floating mass to gain, Sudden I dropp'd amidst the flashing main; Once more undaunted on the ruin rode, And oar'd with labouring arms along the flood. Unseen I pass'd by Scylla's dire abodes. So Jove decreed (dread sire of men and gods). Then nine long days I plow'd the calmer seas, Heaved by the surge, and wafted by the breeze.</p></div> </div>
