"Ah! doubt not our report (the prince rejoin'd) Of all the virtues of thy generous mind. And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet! To him thy presents show, thy words repeat: How will each speech his grateful wonder raise! How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!"</p><p>Scarce ended thus the prince, when on the right Advanced the bird of Jove: auspicious sight! A milk-white fowl his clinching talons bore, With care domestic pampered at the floor. Peasants in vain with threatening cries pursue, In solemn speed the bird majestic flew Full dexter to the car; the prosperous sight Fill'd every breast with wonder and delight.</p></div> </div>
