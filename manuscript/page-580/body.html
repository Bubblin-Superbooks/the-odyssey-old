<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The goddess Minerva commands Telemachus in a vision to return to Ithaca. Pisistratus and he take leave of Menelaus, and arrive at Pylos, where they part: and Telemachus sets sail, after having received on board Theoclymenus the soothsayer. The scene then changes to the cottage of Eumaeus, who entertains Ulysses with a recital of his adventures. In the meantime Telemachus arrives on the coast, and sending the vessel to the town, proceeds by himself to the lodge of Eumaeus.</p><p>Now had Minerva reach'd those ample plains, Famed for the dance, where Menelaus reigns: Anxious she flies to great Ulysses' heir, His instant voyage challenged all her care. Beneath the royal portico display'd, With Nestor's son Telemachus was laid: In sleep profound the son of Nestor lies; Not thine, Ulysses! Care unseal'd his eyes: Restless he grieved, with various fears oppress'd, And all thy fortunes roll'd within his breast.</p></div> </div>
