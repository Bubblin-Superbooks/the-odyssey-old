<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Behold a wretch whom all the gods consign To woe! Did ever sorrows equal mine? Long to my joys my dearest lord is lost, His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast; Now from my fond embrace, by tempests torn, Our other column of the state is borne; Nor took a kind adieu, nor sought consent!-- Unkind confederates in his dire intent! Ill suits it with your shows of duteous zeal, From me the purposed voyage to conceal; Though at the solemn midnight hour he rose, Why did you fear to trouble my repose? He either had obey'd my fond desire, Or seen his mother pierced with grief expire. Bid Dolius quick attend, the faithful slave Whom to my nuptial train Icarius gave To tend the fruit groves: with incessant speed He shall this violence of death decreed To good Laertes tell. Experienced age May timely intercept the ruffian rage. Convene the tribes the murderous plot reveal, And to their power to save his race appeal."</p></div> </div>
