<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The rugged race of savages, unskill'd The seas to traverse, or the ships to build, Gaze on the coast, nor cultivate the soil, Unlearn'd in all the industrious art of toil, Yet here all produces and all plants abound, Sprung from the fruitful genius of the ground; Fields waving high with heavy crops are seen, And vines that flourish in eternal green, Refreshing meads along the murmuring main, And fountains streaming down the fruitful plain.</p><p>"A port there is, inclosed on either side, Where ships may rest, unanchor'd and untied; Till the glad mariners incline to sail, And the sea whitens with the rising gale, High at the head, from out the cavern'd rock, In living rills a gushing fountain broke: Around it, and above, for ever green, The busy alders form'd a shady scene; Hither some favouring god, beyond our thought, Through all surrounding shade our navy brought;</p></div> </div>
