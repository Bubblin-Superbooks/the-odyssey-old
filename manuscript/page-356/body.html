<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> E'en the stern god that o'er the waves presides, Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides, With fury burns; while careless they convey Promiscuous every guest to every bay, These ears have heard my royal sire disclose A dreadful story, big with future woes; How Neptune raged, and how, by his command, Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand A monument of wrath; how mound on mound Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground. But this the gods may frustrate or fulfil, As suits the purpose of the Eternal Will. But say through what waste regions hast thou stray'd What customs noted, and what coasts survey'd; Possess'd by wild barbarians fierce in arms, Or men whose bosom tender pity warms? Say why the fate of Troy awaked thy cares, Why heaved thy bosom, and why flowed thy tears? Just are the ways of Heaven: from Heaven proceed The woes of man;</p></div> </div>
