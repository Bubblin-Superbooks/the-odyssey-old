<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Before the Grecians touch'd the Trojan plain, Nine times commander or by land or main, In foreign fields I spread my glory far, Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war; Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame, To Crete return'd, an honourable name. But when great Jove that direful war decreed, Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed; Our states myself and Idomen employ To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy. Nine years we warr'd; the tenth saw Ilion fall; Homeward we sail'd, but heaven dispersed us all. One only month my wife enjoy'd my stay; So will'd the god who gives and takes away.</p></div> </div>
