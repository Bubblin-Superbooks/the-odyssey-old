<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn, Sprinkled with roseate light the dewy lawn, In haste the prince arose, prepared to part; His hand impatient grasps the pointed dart; Fair on his feet the polish'd sandals shine, And thus he greets the master of the swine:</p><p>"My friend, adieu! let this short stay suffice; I haste to meet my mother's longing eyes, And end her tears, her sorrows and her sighs. But thou, attentive, what we order heed: This hapless stranger to the city lead: By public bounty let him there be fed, And bless the hand that stretches forth the bread. To wipe the tears from all afflicted eyes, My will may covet, but my power denies. If this raise anger in the stranger's thought, The pain of anger punishes the fault: The very truth I undisguised declare; For what so easy as to be sincere?"</p></div> </div>
