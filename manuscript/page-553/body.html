<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>deck I take my dangerous stand, Two glittering javelins lighten in my hand; Prepared to whirl the whizzing spear I stay, Till the fell fiend arise to seize her prey. Around the dungeon, studious to behold The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll'd; In vain! the dismal dungeon, dark as night, Veils the dire monster, and confounds the sight.</p><p>"Now through the rocks, appall'd with deep dismay, We bend our course, and stem the desperate way; Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms, And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms.</p></div> </div>
