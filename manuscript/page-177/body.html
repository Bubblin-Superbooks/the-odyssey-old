With all my affluence, when my woes are weigh'd, Envy will own the purchase dearly paid. For eight slow-circling years, by tempests toss'd, From Cypress to the far Phoenician coast (Sidon the capital), I stretch'd my toil Through regions fatten'd with the flows of Nile. Next Aethiopia's utmost bound explore, And the parch'd borders of the Arabian shore; Then warp my voyage on the southern gales, O'er the warm Lybian wave to spread my sails; That happy clime, where each revolving year The teeming ewes a triple offspring bear; And two fair crescents of translucent horn The brows of all their young increase adorn: The shepherd swains, with sure abundance blest, On the fat flock and rural dainties feast;</p></div> </div>
