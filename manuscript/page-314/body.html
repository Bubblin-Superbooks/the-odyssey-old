<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>wood; Or azure daughters of the silver flood; Or human voice? but issuing from the shades, Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?"</p><p>Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends, With forceful strength a branch the hero rends; Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads A wreathy foliage and concealing shades. As when a lion in the midnight hours, Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers, Descends terrific from the mountains brow; With living flames his rolling eye balls glow; With conscious strength elate, he bends his way, Majestically fierce, to seize his prey (The steer or stag;) or, with keen hunger bold, Spring o'er the fence and dissipates the fold.</p></div> </div>
