<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Twelve feet, deform'd and foul, the fiend dispreads; Six horrid necks she rears, and six terrific heads; Her jaws grin dreadful with three rows of teeth; Jaggy they stand, the gaping den of death; Her parts obscene the raging billows hide; Her bosom terribly o'erlooks the tide. When stung with hunger she embroils the flood, The sea-dog and the dolphin are her food; She makes the huge leviathan her prey, And all the monsters of the watery way; The swiftest racer of the azure plain Here fills her sails, and spreads her oars in vain; Fell Scylla rises, in her fury roars, At once six mouths expands, at once six men devours.</p><p>"'Close by, a rock of less enormous height Breaks the wild waves, and forms a dangerous strait; Full on its crown a fig's green branches rise, And shoot a leafy forest to the skies;</p></div> </div>
