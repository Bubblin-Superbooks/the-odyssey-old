<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So watery fowl, that seek their fishy food, With wings expanded o'er the foaming flood, Now sailing smooth the level surface sweep, Now dip their pinions in the briny deep; Thus o'er the word of waters Hermes flew, Till now the distant island rose in view: Then, swift ascending from the azure wave, he took the path that winded to the cave. Large was the grot, in which the nymph he found (The fair-hair'd nymph with every beauty crown'd). The cave was brighten'd with a rising blaze; Cedar and frankincense, an odorous pile, Flamed on the hearth, and wide perfumed the isle; While she with work and song the time divides, And through the loom the golden shuttle guides. Without the grot a various sylvan scene Appear'd around, and groves of living green;</p></div> </div>
