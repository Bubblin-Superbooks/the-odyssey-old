Then took a goatskin fill'd with precious wine, The gift of Maron of Evantheus' line (The priest of Phoebus at the Ismarian shrine). In sacred shade his honour'd mansion stood Amidst Apollo's consecrated wood; Him, and his house, Heaven moved my mind to save, And costly presents in return he gave; Seven golden talents to perfection wrought, A silver bowl that held a copious draught, And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine, Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine! Which now, some ages from his race conceal'd, The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd.</p></div> </div>
