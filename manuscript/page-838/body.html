Meantime the menial train with unctious wood Heap'd high the genial hearth, Vulcanian food: When, early dress'd, advanced the royal heir; With manly grasp he waved a martial spear; A radiant sabre graced his purple zone, And on his foot the golden sandal shone. His steps impetuous to the portal press'd; And Euryclea thus he there address'd:</p><p>"Say thou to whom my youth its nurture owes, Was care for due refection and repose Bestow'd the stranger-guest? Or waits he grieved, His age not honour'd, nor his wants relieved? Promiscuous grace on all the queen confers (In woes bewilder'd, oft the wisest errs). The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires, And modest worth with noble scorn retires."</p></div> </div>
