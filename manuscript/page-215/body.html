I boast a witness of his worth in thee."</p><p>"Young and mature! (the monarch thus rejoins,) In thee renew'd the soul of Nestor shines; Form'd by the care of that consummate sage, In early bloom an oracle of age. Whene'er his influence Jove vouchsafes to shower, To bless the natal and the nuptial hour; From the great sire transmissive to the race, The boon devolving gives distinguish'd grace.</p></div> </div>
