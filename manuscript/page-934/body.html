<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O let me, let me not thine anger move, That I forbore, thus, thus to speak my love: Thus in fond kisses, while the transport warms Pour out my soul and die within thine arms! I dreaded fraud! Men, faithless men, betray Our easy faith, and make our sex their prey: Against the fondness of my heart I strove: 'Twas caution, O my lord! not want of love. Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms; Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day; Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray. But Heaven, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed: Blind to the ills that from injustice flow, She colour'd all our wretched lives with woe.</p></div> </div>
