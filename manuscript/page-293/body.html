<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not more renown'd the men of Scheria's isle For sailing arts and all the naval toil, Than works of female skill their women's pride, The flying shuttle through the threads to guide: Pallas to these her double gifts imparts, Incentive genius, and industrious arts.</p><p>Close to the gates a spacious garden lies, From storms defended and inclement skies. Four acres was the allotted space of ground, Fenced with a green enclosure all around. Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mould: The reddening apple ripens here to gold. Here the blue fig with luscious juice o'erflows, With deeper red the full pomegranate glows; The branch here bends beneath the weighty pear, And verdant olives flourish round the year, The balmy spirit of the western gale Eternal breathes on fruits, unthought to fail: Each dropping pear a following pear supplies, On apples apples, figs on figs arise: The same mild season gives the blooms to blow, The buds to harden, and the fruits to grow.</p></div> </div>
