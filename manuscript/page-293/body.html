Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain, Return the gift, and cast it in the main: Observe my orders, and with heed obey, Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away."</p><p>With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows, Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose; A moment snatch'd the shining form away, And all was covered with the curling sea.</p><p>Struck with amaze, yet still to doubt inclined, He stands suspended, and explores his mind: "What shall I do? unhappy me! who knows But other gods intend me other woes? Whoe'er thou art, I shall not blindly join Thy pleaded reason, but consult with mine: For scarce in ken appears that distant isle Thy voice foretells me shall conclude my toil.</p></div> </div>
