(Thus interposed the martial maid divine) Forgetful youth! but know, the Power above With ease can save each object of his love; Wide as his will, extends his boundless grace; Nor lost in time nor circumscribed by place. Happier his lot, who, many sorrows' pass'd, Long labouring gains his natal shore at last; Than who, too speedy, hastes to end his life By some stern ruffian, or adulterous wife. Death only is the lot which none can miss, And all is possible to Heaven but this. The best, the dearest favourite of the sky, Must taste that cup, for man is born to die."</p><p>Thus check'd, replied Ulysses' prudent heir: "Mentor, no more--the mournful thought forbear; For he no more must draw his country's breath, Already snatch'd by fate, and the black doom of death! Pass we to other subjects;</p></div> </div>
