When lo! an odour from the feast exhales, Spreads o'er the coast and scents the tainted gales; A chilly fear congeal'd my vital blood, And thus, obtesting Heaven, I mourn'd aloud;</p><p>"'O sire of men and gods, immortal Jove! O all ye blissful powers that reign above! Why were my cares beguiled in short repose? O fatal slumber, paid with lasting woes! A deed so dreadful all the gods alarms, Vengeance is on the wing, and Heaven in arms!'</p><p>"Meantime Lampetie mounts the aerial way, And kindles into rage the god of day;</p></div> </div>
