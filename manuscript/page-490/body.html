Warn'd by the high command of Heaven, be awed: Holy the flocks, and dreadful is the god! That god who spreads the radiant beams of light, And views wide earth and heaven's unmeasured height.'</p><p>"And now the moon had run her monthly round, The south-east blustering with a dreadful sound: Unhurt the beeves, untouch'd the woolly train, Low through the grove, or touch the flowery plain: Then fail'd our food: then fish we make our prey, Or fowl that screaming haunt the watery way. Till now from sea or flood no succour found, Famine and meagre want besieged us round.</p></div> </div>
