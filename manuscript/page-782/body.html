A double strength of valves secured the place, A high and narrow; but the only pass: The cautious king, with all-preventing care, To guard that outlet, placed Eumaeus there; When Agelaus thus: "Has none the sense To mount yon window, and alarm from thence The neighbour-town? the town shall force the door, And this bold archer soon shall shoot no more." Melanthius then: "That outlet to the gate So near adjoins, that one may guard the strait. But other methods of defence remain; Myself with arms can furnish all the train; Stores from the royal magazine I bring, And their own darts shall pierce the prince and king."</p></div> </div>
