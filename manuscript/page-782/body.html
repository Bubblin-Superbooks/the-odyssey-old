Irreverent to the great, and uncontroll'd, Art thou from wine, or innate folly, bold? Perhaps these outrages from Irus flow, A worthless triumph o'er a worthless foe!"</p><p>He said, and with full force a footstool threw; Whirl'd from his arm, with erring rage it flew: Ulysses, cautious of the vengeful foe, Stoops to the ground, and disappoints the blow. Not so a youth, who deals the goblet round, Full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound; Dash'd from his hand the sounding goblet flies, He shrieks, he reels, he falls, and breathless lies.</p></div> </div>
