<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Not Argus so, (Eumaeus thus rejoin'd,) But served a master of a nobler kind, Who, never, never shall behold him more! Long, long since perish'd on a distant shore! Oh had you seen him, vigorous, bold, and young, Swift as a stag, and as a lion strong: Him no fell savage on the plain withstood, None 'scaped him bosom'd in the gloomy wood; His eye how piercing, and his scent how true, To wind the vapour on the tainted dew! Such, when Ulysses left his natal coast: Now years unnerve him, and his lord is lost! The women keep the generous creature bare, A sleek and idle race is all their care: The master gone, the servants what restrains? Or dwells humanity where riot reigns? Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away."</p></div> </div>
