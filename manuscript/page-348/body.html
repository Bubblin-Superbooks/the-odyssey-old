<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>(with modest grace rejoin'd The prudent Greek) possess the royal mind. Alas! a mortal, like thyself, am I; No glorious native of yon azure sky: In form, ah how unlike their heavenly kind! How more inferior in the gifts of mind! Alas, a mortal! most oppress'd of those Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes; By a sad train of Miseries alone Distinguish'd long, and second now to none! By Heaven's high will compell'd from shore to shore; With Heaven's high will prepared to suffer more. What histories of toil could I declare! But still long-wearied nature wants repair; Spent with fatigue, and shrunk with pining fast, My craving bowels still require repast.</p></div> </div>
