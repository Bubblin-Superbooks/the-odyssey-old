Soon as the morn, in orient purple dress'd, Unbarr'd the portal of the roseate east, The monarch rose; magnificent to view, The imperial mantle o'er his vest he threw; The glittering zone athwart his shoulders cast, A starry falchion low-depending graced; Clasp'd on his feet the embroidered sandals shine; And forth he moves, majestic and divine, Instant to young Telemachus he press'd; And thus benevolent his speech addressed:</p><p>"Say, royal youth, sincere of soul report Whit cause hath led you to the Spartan court? Do public or domestic care constrain This toilsome voyage o'er the surgy main?"</p></div> </div>
