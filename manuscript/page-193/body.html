With patient ear, O royal youth, attend The storied labour of thy father's friend: Fruitful of deeds, the copious tale is long, But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue: Learn what I heard the sea-born seer relate, Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate.</p><p>"Long on the Egyptian coast by calms confined, Heaven to my fleet refused a prosperous wind; No vows had we preferr'd, nor victims slain! For this the gods each favouring gale restrain Jealous, to see their high behests obey'd; Severe, if men the eternal rights evade. High o'er a gulfy sea, the Pharian isle Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing Nile: Her distance from the shore, the course begun At dawn, and ending with the setting sun, A galley measures; when the stiffer gales Rise on the poop, and fully stretch the sails. There, anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lie, Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply.</p></div> </div>
