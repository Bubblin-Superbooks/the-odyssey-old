I boast a witness of his worth in thee."</p><p>"Young and mature! (the monarch thus rejoins,) In thee renew'd the soul of Nestor shines; Form'd by the care of that consummate sage, In early bloom an oracle of age. Whene'er his influence Jove vouchsafes to shower, To bless the natal and the nuptial hour; From the great sire transmissive to the race, The boon devolving gives distinguish'd grace. Such, happy Nestor! was thy glorious doom, Around thee, full of years, thy offspring bloom. Expert of arms, and prudent in debate; The gifts of Heaven to guard thy hoary state. But now let each becalm his troubled breast, Wash, and partake serene the friendly feast. To move thy suit, Telemachus, delay, Till heaven's revolving lamp restores the day."</p></div> </div>
