Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes would raise, Historic marbles to record his praise; His praise, eternal on the faithful stone, Had with transmissive honour graced his son. Now snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast. Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost; Vanish'd at once! unheard of, and unknown! And I his heir in misery alone.</p></div> </div>
