<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast The rage of hunger and of thirst repress'd: To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent: A son of Dolius on the message went, Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld The foe approach, embattled on the field. With backward step he hastens to the bower, And tells the news. They arm with all their power. Four friends alone Ulysses' cause embrace, And six were all the sons of Dolius' race: Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on; And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone. Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand, And brazen panoply invests the band. The opening gates at once their war display: Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way.</p></div> </div>
