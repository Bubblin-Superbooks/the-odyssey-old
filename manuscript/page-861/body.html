Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine They drop their javelins, and their rage resign. All scatter'd round their glittering weapons lie; Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly. With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along, Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong.

Ulysses, cease; Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace."</p></div> </div>
