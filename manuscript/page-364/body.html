<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Transported with the song, the listening train Again with loud applause demand the strain; Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head. Again unmann'd, a shower of sorrows shed; Conceal'd he wept; the king observed alone The silent tear, and heard the secret groan; Then to the bard aloud--"O cease to sing, Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string; Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power Of heavenly song has crown'd the genial hour! Incessant in the games your strength display, Contest, ye brave the honours of the day! That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim In distant regions the Phaeacian fame: None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway, Or swifter in the race devour the way; None in the leap spring with so strong a bound, Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground."</p></div> </div>
