But honouring age, in mercy I refrain: In peace away! lest, if persuasions fail, This arm with blows more eloquent prevail." To whom, with stern regard: "O insolence, Indecently to rail without offence! What bounty gives without a rival share; I ask, what harms not thee, to breathe this air: Alike on alms we both precarious live: And canst thou envy when the great relieve? Know, from the bounteous heavens all riches flow, And what man gives, the gods by man bestow; Proud as thou art, henceforth no more be proud, Lest I imprint my vengeance in thy blood;</p></div> </div>
