Thick o'er the board the plenteous viands lay, The frugal remnants of the former day. Then in a bowl he tempers generous wines, Around whose verge a mimic ivy twines. And now, the rage of thirst and hunger fled, Thus young Ulysses to Eumaeus said:</p><p>"Whence, father, from what shore this stranger, say? What vessel bore him o'er the watery way? To human step our land impervious lies, And round the coast circumfluent oceans rise."</p><p>The swain returns: "A tale of sorrows hear: In spacious Crete he drew his natal air; Long doom'd to wander o'er the land and main, For Heaven has wove his thread of life with pain. Half breathless 'scaping to the land he flew From Thesprot mariners, a murderous crew. To thee, my son, the suppliant I resign; I gave him my protection, grant him thine."</p></div> </div>
