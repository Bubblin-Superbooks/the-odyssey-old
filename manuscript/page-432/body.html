<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Soon might'st thou tell me, where in secret here The dastard lurks, all trembling with his fear: Swung round and round, and dash'd from rock to rock, His battered brains should on the pavement smoke No ease, no pleasure my sad heart receives, While such a monster as vile Noman lives.'</p><p>"The giant spoke, and through the hollow rock Dismiss'd the ram, the father of the flock. No sooner freed, and through the inclosure pass'd, First I release myself, my fellows last: Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before, And reach our vessel on the winding shore. With joy the sailors view their friends return'd, And hail us living whom as dead they mourn'd Big tears of transport stand in every eye: I check their fondness, and command to fly.</p></div> </div>
