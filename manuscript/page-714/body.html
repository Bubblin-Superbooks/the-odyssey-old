Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise; The walls, where'er my wondering sight I turn, And roofs, amidst a blaze of glory burn! Some visitant of pure ethereal race With his bright presence deigns the dome to grace."</p><p>"Be calm (replies the sire); to none impart, But oft revolve the vision in thy heart: Celestials, mantled in excess of light, Can visit unapproach'd by mortal sight. Seek thou repose: whilst here I sole remain, To explore the conduct of the female train: The pensive queen, perchance, desires to know The series of my toils, to soothe her woe."</p><p>With tapers flaming day his train attends, His bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends: Soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close, Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows.</p></div> </div>
