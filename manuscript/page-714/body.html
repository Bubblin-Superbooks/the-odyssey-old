To want like mine the peopled town can yield More hopes of comfort than the lonely field: Nor fits my age to till the labour'd lands, Or stoop to tasks a rural lord demands. Adieu! but since this ragged garb can bear So ill the inclemencies of morning air, A few hours' space permit me here to stay: My steps Eumaeus shall to town convey, With riper beams when Phoebus warms the day."</p></div> </div>
