Then thus began, Her words addressing to the godlike man:</p><p>"Camest thou hither, wondrous stranger I say, From lands remote and o'er a length of sea? Tell, then, whence art thou? whence, that princely air? And robes like these, so recent and so fair?"</p><p>"Hard is the task, O princess! you impose (Thus sighing spoke the man of many woes), The long, the mournful series to relate Of all my sorrows sent by Heaven and Fate! Yet what you ask, attend. An island lies Beyond these tracts, and under other skies, Ogygia named, in Ocean's watery arms; Where dwells Calypso, dreadful in her charms! Remote from gods or men she holds her reign, Amid the terrors of a rolling main.</p></div> </div>
