<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Strong was the tide, which by the northern blast Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast, Nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore: The tenth we touch'd, by various errors toss'd, The land of Lotus and the flowery coast. We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found, Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground. Three men were sent, deputed from the crew (A herald one) the dubious coast to view, And learn what habitants possess'd the place. They went, and found a hospitable race: Not prone to ill, nor strange to foreign guest, They eat, they drink, and nature gives the feast The trees around them all their food produce: Lotus the name: divine, nectareous juice! (Thence call'd Lo'ophagi); which whose tastes, Insatiate riots in the sweet repasts, Nor other home, nor other care intends, But quits his house, his country, and his friends.</p></div> </div>
