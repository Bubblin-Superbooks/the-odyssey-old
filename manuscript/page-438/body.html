<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"There in a lonely land, and gloomy cells, The dusky nation of Cimmeria dwells; The sun ne'er views the uncomfortable seats, When radiant he advances, or retreats: Unhappy race! whom endless night invades, Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in shades.</p><p>"The ship we moor on these obscure abodes; Disbark the sheep, an offering to the gods; And, hellward bending, o'er the beach descry The doleful passage to the infernal sky. The victims, vow'd to each Tartarian power, Eurylochus and Perimedes bore.</p><p>"Here open'd hell, all hell I here implored, And from the scabbard drew the shining sword: And trenching the black earth on every side, A cavern form'd, a cubit long and wide. New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring, Then living waters from the crystal spring: O'er these was strew'd the consecrated flour, And on the surface shone the holy store.</p></div> </div>
