A freshening breeze the magic power supplied, While the wing'd vessel flew along the tide; Our oars we shipp'd; all day the swelling sails Full from the guiding pilot catch'd the gales.</p><p>"Now sunk the sun from his aerial height, And o'er the shaded billows rush'd the night; When lo! we reach'd old Ocean's utmost bounds, Where rocks control his waves with ever-during mounds.</p></div> </div>
