<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There disembarking on the green sea side, We land our cattle, and the spoil divide; Of these due shares to every sailor fall; The master ram was voted mine by all; And him (the guardian of Ulysses' fate) With pious mind to heaven I consecrate. But the great god, whose thunder rends the skies, Averse, beholds the smoking sacrifice; And sees me wandering still from coast to coast, And all my vessels, all my people, lost! While thoughtless we indulge the genial rite, As plenteous cates and flowing bowls invite; Till evening Phoebus roll'd away the light; Stretch'd on the shore in careless ease we rest, Till ruddy morning purpled o'er the east; Then from their anchors all our ships unbind, And mount the decks, and call the willing wind.</p></div> </div>
