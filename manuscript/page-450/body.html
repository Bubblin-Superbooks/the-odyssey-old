When lo! advanced the forms of heroes slain By stern AEgysthus, a majestic train: And, high above the rest Atrides press'd the plain. He quaff'd the gore; and straight his soldier knew, And from his eyes pour'd down the tender dew: His arms he stretch'd; his arms the touch deceive, Nor in the fond embrace, embraces give: His substance vanish'd, and his strength decay'd, Now all Atrides is an empty shade.</p><p>"Moved at the sight, I for a apace resign'd To soft affliction all my manly mind; At last with tears: 'O what relentless doom, Imperial phantom, bow'd thee to the tomb? Say while the sea, and while the tempest raves, Has Fate oppress'd thee in the roaring waves, Or nobly seized thee in the dire alarms Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms?'</p></div> </div>
