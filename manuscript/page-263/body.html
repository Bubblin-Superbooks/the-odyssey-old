<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform: Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm; Strip off thy garments; Neptune's fury brave With naked strength, and plunge into the wave. To reach Phaeacia all thy nerves extend, There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end. This heavenly scarf beneath thy bosom bind, And live; give all thy terrors to the wind. Soon as thy arms the happy shore shall gain, Return the gift, and cast it in the main: Observe my orders, and with heed obey, Cast it far off, and turn thy eyes away."</p><p>With that, her hand the sacred veil bestows, Then down the deeps she dived from whence she rose; A moment snatch'd the shining form away, And all was covered with the curling sea.</p></div> </div>
