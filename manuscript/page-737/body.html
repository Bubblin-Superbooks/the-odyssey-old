<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ulysses be his name! And when with filial love the youth shall come To view his mother's soil, my Delphic dome With gifts of price shall send him joyous home." Lured with the promised boon, when youthful prime Ended in man, his mother's natal clime Ulysses sought; with fond affection dear Amphitea's arms received the royal heir: Her ancient lord an equal joy possess'd; Instant he bade prepare the genial feast: A steer to form the sumptuous banquet bled, Whose stately growth five flowery summers fed: His sons divide, and roast with artful care The limbs; then all the tasteful viands share. Nor ceased discourse (the banquet of the soul), Till Phoebus wheeling to the western goal Resign'd the skies, and night involved the pole. Their drooping eyes the slumberous shade oppress'd, Sated they rose, and all retired to rest.</p></div> </div>
