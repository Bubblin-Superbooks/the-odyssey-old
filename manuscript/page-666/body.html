<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The sage Ulysses, fearful to disclose The hero latent in the man of woes, Check'd half his might; yet rising to the stroke, His jawbone dash'd, the crashing jawbone broke: Down dropp'd he stupid from the stunning wound; His feet extended quivering, beat the ground; His mouth and nostrils spout a purple flood; His teeth, all shatter'd, rush inmix'd with blood.</p><p>The peers transported, as outstretch'd he lies, With bursts of laughter rend the vaulted skies; Then dragg'd along, all bleeding from the wound, His length of carcase trailing prints the ground: Raised on his feet, again he reels, he falls, Till propp'd, reclining on the palace walls: Then to his hand a staff the victor gave, And thus with just reproach address'd the slave: "There terrible, affright with dogs, and reign A dreaded tyrant o'er the bestial train! But mercy to the poor and stranger show, Lest Heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe."</p></div> </div>
