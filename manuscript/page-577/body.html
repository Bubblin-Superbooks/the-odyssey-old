Instant, the racer vanish'd off the ground; That instant in his cloak I wrapp'd me round: And safe I slept, till brightly-dawning shone The morn conspicuous on her golden throne.</p><p>"Oh were my strength as then, as then my age! Some friend would fence me from the winter's rage. Yet, tatter'd as I look, I challenged then The honours and the offices of men: Some master, or some servant would allow A cloak and vest--but I am nothing now!"</p><p>"Well hast thou spoke (rejoin'd the attentive swain): Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain! Nor garment shalt thou want, nor aught beside, Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide. But in the morning take thy clothes again, For here one vest suffices every swain: No change of garments to our hinds is known;</p></div> </div>
