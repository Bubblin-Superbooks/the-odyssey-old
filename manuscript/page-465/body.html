<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"The ghost returns: 'O chief of human kind For active courage and a patient mind; Nor while the sea, nor while the tempest raves Has Fate oppress'd me on the roaring waves! Nor nobly seized me in the dire alarms Of war and slaughter, and the clash of arms Stabb'd by a murderous hand Atrides died, A foul adulterer, and a faithless bride; E'en in my mirth, and at the friendly feast, O'er the full bowl, the traitor stabb'd his guest; Thus by the gory arm of slaughter falls The stately ox, and bleeds within the stalls. But not with me the direful murder ends, These, these expired! their crime, they were my friends: Thick as the boars, which some luxurious lord Kills for the feast, to crown the nuptial board.</p></div> </div>
