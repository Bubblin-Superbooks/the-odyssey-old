I ratify my speech, before the sun His annual longitude of heaven shall run; When the pale empress of yon starry train In the next month renews her faded wane, Ulysses will assert his rightful reign."</p><p>"What thanks! what boon! (replied the queen), are due, When time shall prove the storied blessing true! My lord's return should fate no more retard, Envy shall sicken at thy vast reward. But my prophetic fears, alas! presage The wounds of Destiny's relentless rage. I long must weep, nor will Ulysses come, With royal gifts to send you honour'd home!-- Your other task, ye menial train forbear: Now wash the stranger, and the bed prepare: With splendid palls the downy fleece adorn: Uprising early with the purple morn.</p></div> </div>
