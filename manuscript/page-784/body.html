Guard he his guest beneath whose roof he stands: This justice, this the social rite demands."</p><p>The peers assent: the goblet Mulius crown'd With purple juice, and bore in order round: Each peer successive his libation pours To the blest gods who fill'd the ethereal bowers: Then swill'd with wine, with noise the crowds obey, And rushing forth, tumultuous reel away.</p><p>BOOK XIX.</p></div> </div>
