<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Full at Eupithes drove the deathful spear: The brass-cheek'd helmet opens to the wound; He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound. Before the father and the conquering son Heaps rush on heaps, they fight, they drop, they run Now by the sword, and now the javelin, fall The rebel race, and death had swallow'd all; But from on high the blue-eyed virgin cried; Her awful voice detain'd the headlong tide: "Forbear, ye nations, your mad hands forbear From mutual slaughter; Peace descends to spare." Fear shook the nations: at the voice divine They drop their javelins, and their rage resign. All scatter'd round their glittering weapons lie; Some fall to earth, and some confusedly fly.</p></div> </div>
