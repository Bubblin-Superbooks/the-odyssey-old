<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The prudent queen the lofty stair ascends: At distance due a virgin-train attends; A brazen key she held, the handle turn'd, With steel and polish'd elephant adorn'd: Swift to the inmost room she bent her way, Where, safe reposed, the royal treasures lay: There shone high heap'd the labour'd brass and ore, And there the bow which great Ulysses bore; And there the quiver, where now guiltless slept Those winged deaths that many a matron wept.</p><p>This gift, long since when Sparta's shore he trod, On young Ulysses Iphitus bestowed: Beneath Orsilochus' roof they met; One loss was private, one a public debt; Messena's state from Ithaca detains Three hundred sheep, and all the shepherd swains; And to the youthful prince to urge the laws, The king and elders trust their common cause.</p></div> </div>
