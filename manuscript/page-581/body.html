<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When, "O Telemachus! (the goddess said) Too long in vain, too widely hast thou stray'd, Thus leaving careless thy paternal right The robbers' prize, the prey to lawless might. On fond pursuits neglectful while you roam, E'en now the hand of rapine sacks the dome. Hence to Atrides; and his leave implore To launch thy vessel for thy natal shore; Fly, whilst thy mother virtuous yet withstands Her kindred's wishes, and her sire's commands; Through both, Eurymachus pursues the dame, And with the noblest gifts asserts his claim. Hence, therefore, while thy stores thy own remain; Thou know'st the practice of the female train, Lost in the children of the present spouse, They slight the pledges of their former vows; Their love is always with the lover past; Still the succeeding flame expels the last. Let o'er thy house some chosen maid preside, Till Heaven decrees to bless thee in a bride.</p></div> </div>
