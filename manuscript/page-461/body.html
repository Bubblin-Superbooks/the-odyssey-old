<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Till now approaching nigh the magic bower, Where dwelt the enchantress skill'd in herbs of power, A form divine forth issued from the wood (Immortal Hermes with the golden rod) In human semblance. On his bloomy face Youth smiled celestial, with each opening grace. He seized my hand, and gracious thus began: 'Ah whither roam'st thou, much-enduring man? O blind to fate! what led thy steps to rove The horrid mazes of this magic grove? Each friend you seek in yon enclosure lies, All lost their form, and habitants of sties. Think'st thou by wit to model their escape? Sooner shalt thou, a stranger to thy shape, Fall prone their equal: first thy danger know, Then take the antidote the gods bestow.</p></div> </div>
