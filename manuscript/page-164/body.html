<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> My sire I seek, where'er the voice of fame Has told the glories of his noble name, The great Ulysses; famed from shore to shore For valour much, for hardy suffering more. Long time with thee before proud Ilion's wall In arms he fought; with thee beheld her fall. Of all the chiefs, this hero's fate alone Has Jove reserved, unheard of, and unknown; Whether in fields by hostile fury slain, Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main? Of this to learn, oppress'd with tender fears, Lo, at thy knee his suppliant son appears. If or thy certain eye, or curious ear, Have learnt his fate, the whole dark story clear And, oh! whate'er Heaven destined to betide, Let neither flattery soothe, nor pity hide.</p></div> </div>
