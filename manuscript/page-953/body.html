<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thetis herself to all our peers proclaims Heroic prizes and exequial games; The gods assented; and around thee lay Rich spoils and gifts that blazed against the day. Oft have I seen with solemn funeral games Heroes and kings committed to the flames; But strength of youth, or valour of the brave, With nobler contest ne'er renown'd a grave. Such were the games by azure Thetis given, And such thy honours, O beloved of Heaven! Dear to mankind thy fame survives, nor fades Its bloom eternal in the Stygian shades. But what to me avail my honours gone, Successful toils, and battles bravely won? Doom'd by stern Jove at home to end my life, By cursed Aegysthus, and a faithless wife!" Thus they: while Hermes o'er the dreary plain Led the sad numbers by Ulysses slain.</p></div> </div>
