<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It is not so with want! how few that feed A wretch unhappy, merely for his need! Unjust to me, and all that serve the state, To love Ulysses is to raise thy hate. For me, suffice the approbation won Of my great mistress, and her godlike son."</p><p>To him Telemachus: "No more incense The man by nature prone to insolence: Injurious minds just answers but provoke"-- Then turning to Antinous, thus he spoke: "Thanks to thy care! whose absolute command Thus drives the stranger from our court and land. Heaven bless its owner with a better mind! From envy free, to charity inclined. This both Penelope and I afford: Then, prince! be bounteous of Ulysses' board. To give another's is thy hand so slow? So much more sweet to spoil than to bestow?"</p></div> </div>
