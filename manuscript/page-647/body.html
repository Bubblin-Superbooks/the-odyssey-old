<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain! Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard, And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus' haughty lord: Hither, to 'scape his chains, my course I steer, Still cursed by Fortune, and insulted here!"</p><p>To whom Antinous thus his rage express'd: "What god has plagued us with this gourmand guest? Unless at distance, wretch! thou keep behind, Another isle, than Cyprus more unkind, Another Egypt shalt thou quickly find. From all thou begg'st, a bold audacious slave; Nor all can give so much as thou canst crave. Nor wonder I, at such profusion shown; Shameless they give, who give what's not their own."</p><p>The chief, retiring: "Souls, like that in thee, Ill suits such forms of grace and dignity. Nor will that hand to utmost need afford The smallest portion of a wasteful board, Whose luxury whole patrimonies sweeps, Yet starving want, amidst the riot, weeps."</p></div> </div>
