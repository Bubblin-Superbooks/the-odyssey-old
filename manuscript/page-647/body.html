<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Light of my eyes: he comes! unhoped-for joy! Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy? So snatch'd from all our cares!--Tell, hast thou known Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own."</p><p>"Oh dearest! most revered of womankind! Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind (Replied the prince); nor be our fates deplored, From death and treason to thy arms restored. Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers; With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers; To every god vow hecatombs to bleed. And call Jove's vengeance on their guilty deed. While to the assembled council I repair: A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there; My new accepted guest I haste to find, Now to Peiraeus' honour'd charge consign'd."</p></div> </div>
