The king observes them, he the hall forsakes, And, past the limits of the court, o'ertakes. Then thus with accent mild Ulysses spoke: "Ye faithful guardians of the herd and flock! Shall I the secret of my breast conceal, Or (as my soul now dictates) shall I tell? Say, should some favouring god restore again The lost Ulysses to his native reign, How beat your hearts? what aid would you afford To the proud suitors, or your ancient lord?"</p><p>Philaetius thus: "O were thy word not vain! Would mighty Jove restore that man again! These aged sinews, with new vigour strung, In his blest cause should emulate the young." With equal vows Eumaeus too implored Each power above, with wishes for his lord.</p></div> </div>
