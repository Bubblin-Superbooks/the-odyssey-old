<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The time would fail should I in order tell What foes were vanquish'd, and what numbers fell: How, lost through love, Eurypylus was slain, And round him bled his bold Cetaean train. To Troy no hero came of nobler line, Or if of nobler, Memnon, it was thine.</p><p>"When Ilion in the horse received her doom, And unseen armies ambush'd in its womb, Greece gave her latent warriors to my care, 'Twas mine on Troy to pour the imprison'd war: Then when the boldest bosom beat with fear, When the stern eyes of heroes dropp'd a tear, Fierce in his look his ardent valour glow'd, Flush'd in his cheek, or sallied in his blood; Indignant in the dark recess he stands, Pants for the battle, and the war demands: His voice breathed death, and with a martial air He grasp'd his sword, and shook his glittering spear.</p></div> </div>
