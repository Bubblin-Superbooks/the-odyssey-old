Not mortal thou, nor mortal is thy brain. Or art thou he, the man to come (foretold By Hermes, powerful with the wand of gold), The man from Troy, who wander'd ocean round; The man for wisdom's various arts renown'd, Ulysses? Oh! thy threatening fury cease; Sheathe thy bright sword, and join our hands in peace! Let mutual joys our mutual trust combine, And love, and love-born confidence, be thine.'</p><p>"'And how, dread Circe! (furious I rejoin) Can love, and love-born confidence, be mine, Beneath thy charms when my companions groan, Transform'd to beasts, with accents not their own? O thou of fraudful heart, shall I be led To share thy feast-rites, or ascend thy bed;</p></div> </div>
