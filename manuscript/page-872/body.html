<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Full many foes and fierce, observe us near; Some may betray, and yonder walls may hear. Re-enter then, not all at once, but stay Some moments you, and let me lead the way. To me, neglected as I am I know The haughty suitors will deny the bow; But thou, Eumaeus, as 'tis borne away, Thy master's weapon to his hand convey. At every portal let some matron wait, And each lock fast the well-compacted gate: Close let them keep, whate'er invades their ear; Though arms, or shouts, or dying groans they hear. To thy strict charge, Philaetius, we consign The court's main gate: to guard that pass be thine."</p><p>This said, he first return'd; the faithful swains At distance follow, as their king ordains.</p></div> </div>
