<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> First came the son; the father nest succeeds, Clad like a beggar, whom Eumaeus leads; Propp'd on a staff, deform'd with age and care, And hung with rags that flutter'd in the air. Who could Ulysses in that form behold? Scorn'd by the young, forgotten by the old, Ill-used by all! to every wrong resigned, Patient he suffered with a constant mind. But when, arising in his wrath to obey The will of Jove, he gave the vengeance way: The scattered arms that hung around the dome Careful he treasured in a private room; Then to her suitors bade his queen propose The archer's strife, the source of future woes, And omen of our death! In vain we drew The twanging string, and tried the stubborn yew: To none it yields but great Ulysses' hands; In vain we threat; Telemachus commands: The bow he snatch'd, and in an instant bent; Through every ring the victor arrow went.</p></div> </div>
