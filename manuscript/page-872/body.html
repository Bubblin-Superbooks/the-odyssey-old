First bleeds Antinous: thick the shafts resound, And heaps on heaps the wretches strew the ground; This way, and that, we turn, we fly, we fall; Some god assisted, and unmann'd us all; Ignoble cries precede the dying groans; And battered brains and blood besmear the stones.</p><p>"Thus, great Atrides, thus Ulysses drove The shades thou seest from yon fair realms above; Our mangled bodies now deformed with gore, Cold and neglected, spread the marble floor. No friend to bathe our wounds, or tears to shed O'er the pale corse! the honours of the dead."</p></div> </div>
