A shameful fate now hides my hapless head, Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!"</p><p>A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke, The raft is cover'd, and the mast is broke; Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn, Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne; While by the howling tempest rent in twain Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o'er the main. Long-press'd, he heaved beneath the weighty wave, Clogg'd by the cumbrous vest Calypso gave; At length, emerging, from his nostrils wide And gushing mouth effused the briny tide; E'en then not mindless of his last retreat, He seized the raft, and leap'd into his seat, Strong with the fear of death.</p></div> </div>
