Thus he, unskill'd of what the fates provide! But with severe rebuke Antinous cried:</p><p>"These empty vaunts will make the voyage vain: Alarm not with discourse the menial train: The great event with silent hope attend, Our deeds alone our counsel must commend." His speech thus ended short, he frowning rose, And twenty chiefs renowned for valour chose; Down to the strand he speeds with haughty strides, Where anchor'd in the bay the vessel rides, Replete with mail and military store, In all her tackle trim to quit the shore. The desperate crew ascend, unfurl the sails (The seaward prow invites the tardy gales); Then take repast till Hesperus display'd His golden circlet, in the western shade.</p></div> </div>
