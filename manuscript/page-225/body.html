Me now the guardian goddess deigns to send, To bid thee patient his return attend."</p><p>The queen replies: "If in the blest abodes, A goddess, thou hast commerce with the gods; Say, breathes my lord the blissful realm of light, Or lies he wrapp'd in ever-during night?"</p><p>"Inquire not of his doom, (the phantom cries,) I speak not all the counsel of the skies; Nor must indulge with vain discourse, or long, The windy satisfaction of the tongue."</p><p>Swift through the valves the visionary fair Repass'd, and viewless mix'd with common air. The queen awakes, deliver'd of her woes; With florid joy her heart dilating glows: The vision, manifest of future fate, Makes her with hope her son's arrival wait.</p></div> </div>
