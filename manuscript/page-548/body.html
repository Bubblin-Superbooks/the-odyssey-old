Sudden, the master runs; aloud he calls; And from his hasty hand the leather falls: With showers of stones he drives then far away: The scattering dogs around at distance bay.</p><p>"Unhappy stranger! (thus the faithful swain Began with accent gracious and humane), What sorrow had been mine, if at my gate Thy reverend age had met a shameful fate! Enough of woes already have I known; Enough my master's sorrows and my own. While here (ungrateful task!) his herds I feed, Ordain'd for lawless rioters to bleed! Perhaps, supported at another's board! Far from his country roams my hapless lord; Or sigh'd in exile forth his latest breath, Now cover'd with the eternal shade of death!</p></div> </div>
