<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But first the king dismiss'd me from his shores, For fair Dulichium crown'd with fruitful stores; To good Acastus' friendly care consign'd: But other counsels pleased the sailors' mind: New frauds were plotted by the faithless train, And misery demands me once again. Soon as remote from shore they plough the wave, With ready hands they rush to seize their slave; Then with these tatter'd rags they wrapp'd me round (Stripp'd of my own), and to the vessel bound. At eve, at Ithaca's delightful land The ship arriv'd: forth issuing on the sand, They sought repast; while to the unhappy kind, The pitying gods themselves my chains unbind. Soft I descended, to the sea applied My naked breast, and shot along the tide. Soon pass'd beyond their sight, I left the flood, And took the spreading shelter of the wood. Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn'd; But deem'd inquiry vain, and to their ships return'd.</p></div> </div>
