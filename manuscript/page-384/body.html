<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"AT length we reach'd AEolias's sea-girt shore, Where great Hippotades the sceptre bore, A floating isle! high-raised by toil divine, Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine. Six blooming youths, in private grandeur bred, And six fair daughters, graced the royal bed; These sons their sisters wed, and all remain Their parents' pride, and pleasure of their reign. All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round, And joy and music through the isle resound; At night each pair on splendid carpets lay, And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day. This happy port affords our wandering fleet A month's reception, and a safe retreat. Full oft the monarch urged me to relate The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate; Full oft I told: at length for parting moved; The king with mighty gifts my suit approved. The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced, Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast.</p></div> </div>
