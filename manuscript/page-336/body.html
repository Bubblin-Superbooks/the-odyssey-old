She feels the triumph of a generous breast; To heal divisions, to relieve the oppress'd; In virtue rich; in blessing others, bless'd. (to then secure, thy humble suit prefer And owe thy country and thy friends to her."</p><p>With that the goddess deign'd no longer stay, But o'er the world of waters wing'd her way; Forsaking Scheria's ever-pleasing shore, The winds to Marathon the virgin bore: Thence, where proud Athens rears her towery head, With opening streets and shining structures spread, She pass'd, delighted with the well-known seats; And to Erectheus' sacred dome retreats.</p></div> </div>
