O Jove! supreme! whom men and gods revere; And thou whose lustre gilds the rolling sphere! With power congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid! Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when, contending on the Lesbian shore, His prowess Philomelides confess'd, And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd: Then soon the invaders of his bed, and throne, Their love presumptuous shall by death atone.</p></div> </div>
