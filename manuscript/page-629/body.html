That grateful Greece with streaming eyes might raise Historic marbles to record his praise; His praise, eternal on the faithful stone, Had with transmissive honours graced his son. Now, snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast, Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost! While pensive in this solitary den, Far from gay cities and the ways of men, I linger life; nor to the court repair, But when my constant queen commands my care; Or when, to taste her hospitable board, Some guest arrives, with rumours of her lord; And these indulge their want, and those their woe, And here the tears and there the goblets flow.</p></div> </div>
