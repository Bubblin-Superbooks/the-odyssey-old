But thou, when morn salutes the aerial plain, The court revisit and the lawless train: Me thither in disguise Eumaeus leads, An aged mendicant in tatter'd weeds. There, if base scorn insult my reverend age, Bear it, my son! repress thy rising rage. If outraged, cease that outrage to repel; Bear it, my son! howe'er thy heart rebel. Yet strive by prayer and counsel to restrain Their lawless insults, though thou strive in vain: For wicked ears are deaf to wisdom's call, And vengeance strikes whom Heaven has doom'd to fall.</p></div> </div>
