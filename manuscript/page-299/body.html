<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If here I enter, my efforts are vain, Dash'd on the cliffs, or heaved into the main; Or round the island if my course I bend, Where the ports open, or the shores descend, Back to the seas the rolling surge may sweep, And bury all my hopes beneath the deep. Or some enormous whale the god may send (For many such an Amphitrite attend); Too well the turns of mortal chance I know, And hate relentless of my heavenly foe." While thus he thought, a monstrous wave upbore The chief, and dash'd him on the craggy shore; Torn was his skin, nor had the ribs been whole, But Instant Pallas enter'd in his soul.</p></div> </div>
