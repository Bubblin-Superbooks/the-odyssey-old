Or I first entering introduce the way? Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear; For like their lawless lords the servants are."</p><p>"Just is, O friend! thy caution, and address'd (Replied the chief, to no unheedful breast:) The wrongs and injuries of base mankind Fresh to my sense, and always in my mind. The bravely-patient to no fortune yields: On rolling oceans, and in fighting fields, Storms have I pass'd, and many a stern debate; And now in humbler scene submit to fate. What cannot want? The best she will expose, And I am learn'd in all her train of woes; She fills with navies, hosts, and loud alarms, The sea, the land, and shakes the world with arms!"</p></div> </div>
