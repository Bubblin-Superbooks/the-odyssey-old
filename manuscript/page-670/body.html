<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But Jove, all-governing, whose only will Determines fate, and mingles good with ill, Sent me (to punish my pursuit of gain) With roving pirates o'er the Egyptian main By Egypt's silver flood our ships we moor; Our spies commission'd straight the coast explore; But impotent of mind, the lawless will The country ravage, and the natives kill. The spreading clamour to their city flies, And horse and foot in mingled tumults rise: The reddening dawn reveals the hostile fields, Horrid with bristly spears, and gleaming shields: Jove thunder'd on their side: our guilty head We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lay dead. Some few the foe in servitude detain; Death ill exchanged for bondage and for pain! Unhappy me a Cyprian took aboard, And gave to Dmetor, Cyprus' haughty lord: Hither, to 'scape his chains, my course I steer, Still cursed by Fortune, and insulted here!"</p></div> </div>
