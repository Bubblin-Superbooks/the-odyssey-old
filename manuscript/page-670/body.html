<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Let those, whom sleep invites, the call obey, Their cares resuming with the dawning day: Here let us feast, and to the feast be join'd Discourse, the sweeter banquet of the mind; Review the series of our lives, and taste The melancholy joy of evils pass'd: For he who much has suffer'd, much will know, And pleased remembrance builds delight on woe.</p><p>"Above Ortygia lies an isle of fame, Far hence remote, and Syria is the name (There curious eyes inscribed with wonder trace The sun's diurnal, and his annual race); Not large, but fruitful; stored with grass to keep The bellowing oxen and the bleating sheep; Her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn, And her rich valleys wave with golden corn.</p></div> </div>
