<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now pleased and satiate from the social rite Repair we to the blessings of the night; But with the rising day, assembled here, Let all the elders of the land appear, Pious observe our hospitable laws, And Heaven propitiate in the stranger's cause; Then join'd in council, proper means explore Safe to transport him to the wished-for shore (How distant that, imports us not to know, Nor weigh the labour, but relieve the woe). Meantime, nor harm nor anguish let him bear This interval, Heaven trusts him to our care But to his native land our charge resign'd, Heaven's is his life to come, and all the woes behind.</p></div> </div>
