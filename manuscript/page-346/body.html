Behold Ulysses! no ignoble name, Earth sounds my wisdom and high heaven my fame.</p><p>"My native soil is Ithaca the fair, Where high Neritus waves his woods in air; Dulichium, Same and Zaccynthus crown'd With shady mountains spread their isles around. (These to the north and night's dark regions run, Those to Aurora and the rising sun). Low lies our isle, yet bless'd in fruitful stores; Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores; And none, ah none no lovely to my sight, Of all the lands that heaven o'erspreads with light. In vain Calypso long constrained my stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; With all her charms as vainly Circe strove, And added magic to secure my love.</p></div> </div>
