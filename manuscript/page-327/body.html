Before his seat a polish'd table shines, And a full goblet foams with generous wines; His food a herald bore; and now they fed; And now the rage of craving hunger fled.</p><p>Then, fired by all the Muse, aloud he sings The mighty deeds of demigods and kings; From that fierce wrath the noble song arose, That made Ulysses and Achilles foes; How o'er the feast they doom the fall of Troy; The stern debate Atrides hears with joy; For Heaven foretold the contest, when he trod The marble threshold of the Delphic god, Curious to learn the counsels of the sky, Ere yet he loosed the rage of war on Troy.</p></div> </div>
