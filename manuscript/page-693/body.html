(he cried)--a god appears! Far other vests thy limbs majestic grace, Far other glories lighten from thy face! If heaven be thy abode, with pious care, Lo! I the ready sacrifice prepare: Lo! gifts of labour'd gold adorn thy shrine, To win thy grace: O save us, power divine!"</p><p>"Few are my days (Ulysses made reply), Nor I, alas! descendant of the sky. I am thy father. O my son! my son! That father, for whose sake thy days have run One scene of woe! to endless cares consign'd, And outraged by the wrongs of base mankind."</p></div> </div>
