<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The menial fair obeys with duteous haste: A seat adorn'd with furry spoils she placed: Due-distant for discourse the hero sate; When thus the sovereign from her chair of state:</p><p>"Reveal, obsequious to my first demand, Thy name, thy lineage, and thy natal land."</p><p>He thus: "O queen! whose far-resounding fame Is bounded only by the starry frame, Consummate pattern of imperial sway, Whose pious rule a warlike race obey! In wavy gold thy summer vales are dress'd; Thy autumns bind with copious fruit oppress'd: With flocks and herds each grassy plain is stored; And fish of every fin thy seas afford: Their affluent joys the grateful realms confess; And bless the power that still delights to bless, Gracious permit this prayer, imperial dame! Forbear to know my lineage, or my name: Urge not this breast to heave, these eyes to weep;</p></div> </div>
