<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Me, only me, the hand of fortune bore, Unblest! to tread that interdicted shore: When Jove tremendous in the sable deeps Launch'd his red lightning at our scattered ships; Then, all my fleet and all my followers lost. Sole on a plank on boiling surges toss'd, Heaven drove my wreck the Ogygian Isle to find, Full nine days floating to the wave and wind. Met by the goddess there with open arms, She bribed my stay with more than human charms; Nay, promised, vainly promised, to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe; But all her blandishments successless prove, To banish from my breast my country's love.</p></div> </div>
