Sufficed it not, within the palace placed, To sit distinguish'd, with our presence graced, Admitted here with princes to confer, A man unknown, a needy wanderer? To copious wine this insolence we owe, And much thy betters wine can overthrow: The great Eurytian when this frenzy stung, Pirithous' roofs with frantic riot rung; Boundless the Centaur raged; till one and all The heroes rose, and dragg'd him from the hall; His nose they shorten'd, and his ears they slit, And sent him sober'd home, with better wit. Hence with long war the double race was cursed, Fatal to all, but to the aggressor first.</p></div> </div>
