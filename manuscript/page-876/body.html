<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there, Nor servants, absent on another care; To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn, Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.</p><p>But all alone the hoary king he found; His habit course, but warmly wrapp'd around; His head, that bow'd with many a pensive care, Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair: His buskins old, in former service torn, But swell repair'd; and gloves against the thorn. In this array the kingly gardener stood, And clear'd a plant, encumber'd with its wood.</p><p>Beneath a neighbouring tree, the chief divine Gazed o'er his sire, retracing every line, The ruins of himself, now worn away With age, yet still majestic in decay! Sudden his eyes released their watery store; The much-enduring man could bear no more.</p></div> </div>
