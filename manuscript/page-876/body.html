Then, to his sire with beating heart he moves, And with a tender pleasantry reproves; Who digging round the plant still hangs his bead, Nor aught remits the work, while thus he said:</p><p>"Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil, Thy careful hand is stamp'd on all the soil, Thy squadron'd vineyards well thy art declare, The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear; And not one empty spot escapes thy care. On every plant and tree thy cares are shown, Nothing neglected, but thyself alone.</p></div> </div>
