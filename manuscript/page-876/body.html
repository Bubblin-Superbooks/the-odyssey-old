The stature of our guest, his port, his face, Speak him descended from no vulgar race. To him the bow, as he desires, convey; And to his hand if Phoebus give the day, Hence, to reward his merit, be shall bear A two-edged falchion and a shining spear, Embroider'd sandals, a rich cloak and vest, A safe conveyance to his port of rest."</p><p>"O royal mother! ever-honour'd name!
