<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now swarms the populace: a countless throng, Youth and boar age; and man drives man along. The games begin; ambitious of the prize, Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise; The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim, Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame. There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear And famed Amphialus, Polyneus' heir; Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose, When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes; Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone, Or equall'd by Laodamas alone. With these came forth Ambasineus the strong: And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung.</p><p>Ranged in a line the ready racers stand, Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand: Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly, And drifts of rising dust involve the sky. Before the rest, what space the hinds allow Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough, Clytonius sprung: he wing'd the rapid way, And bore the unrivall'd honours of the day.</p></div> </div>
