The bravely-patient to no fortune yields: On rolling oceans, and in fighting fields, Storms have I pass'd, and many a stern debate; And now in humbler scene submit to fate. What cannot want? The best she will expose, And I am learn'd in all her train of woes; She fills with navies, hosts, and loud alarms, The sea, the land, and shakes the world with arms!"</p><p>Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew, Argus, the dog, his ancient master knew: He not unconscious of the voice and tread, Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head; Bred by Ulysses, nourish'd at his board, But, ah! not fated long to please his lord; To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain;</p></div> </div>
