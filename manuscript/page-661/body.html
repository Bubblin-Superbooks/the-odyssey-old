Stage above stage the imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours, and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Far other cares its dwellers now employ; The throng'd assembly and the feast of joy: I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire, And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre."</p><p>Then thus Eumaeus: "Judge we which were best; Amidst yon revellers a sudden guest Choose you to mingle, while behind I stay? Or I first entering introduce the way? Wait for a space without, but wait not long; This is the house of violence and wrong: Some rude insult thy reverend age may bear; For like their lawless lords the servants are."</p></div> </div>
