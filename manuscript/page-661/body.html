From Ithaca, of royal birth I came, And great Ulysses (ever honour'd name!) Once was my sire, though now, for ever lost, In Stygian gloom he glides a pensive ghost! Whose fate inquiring through the world we rove; The last, the wretched proof of filial love."</p><p>The stranger then: "Nor shall I aught conceal, But the dire secret of my fate reveal. Of my own tribe an Argive wretch I slew; Whose powerful friends the luckless deed pursue With unrelenting rage, and force from home The blood-stain'd exile, ever doom'd to roam. But bear, oh bear me o'er yon azure flood; Receive the suppliant! spare my destined blood!"</p></div> </div>
