<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Meanwhile Phaeacia's peers in council sate; From his high dome the king descends in state; Then with a filial awe the royal maid Approach'd him passing, and submissive said:</p><p>"Will my dread sire his ear regardful deign, And may his child the royal car obtain? Say, with my garments shall I bend my way? Where through the vales the mazy waters stray? A dignity of dress adorns the great, And kings draw lustre from the robe of state. Five sons thou hast; three wait the bridal day. And spotless robes become the young and gay; So when with praise amid the dance they shine, By these my cares adorn'd that praise is mine."</p></div> </div>
