<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But Heaven denies the praise of thinking well I'll bear the brave a rude ungovern'd tongue, And, youth, my generous soul resents the wrong. Skill'd in heroic exercise, I claim A post of honour with the sons of Fame. Such was my boast while vigour crown'd my days, Now care surrounds me, and my force decays; Inured a melancholy part to bear In scenes of death, by tempest and by war Yet thus by woes impair'd, no more I waive To prove the hero--slander stings the brave."</p><p>Then gliding forward with a furious bound He wrench'd a rocky fragment from the ground By far more ponderous, and more huge by far Than what Phaeacia's sons discharged in air.</p></div> </div>
