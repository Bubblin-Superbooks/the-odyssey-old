<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ulysses, Menelaus, led forth a band, And join'd me with them ('twas their own command); A deathful ambush for the foe to lay, Beneath Troy walls by night we took our way: There, clad in arms, along the marshes spread, We made the osier-fringed bank our bed. Full soon the inclemency of heaven I feel, Nor had these shoulders covering, but of steel. Sharp blew the north; snow whitening all the fields Froze with the blast, and gathering glazed our shields. There all but I, well fenced with cloak and vest, Lay cover'd by their ample shields at rest.</p></div> </div>
