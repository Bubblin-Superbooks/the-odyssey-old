<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus, near the gates conferring as they drew, Argus, the dog, his ancient master knew: He not unconscious of the voice and tread, Lifts to the sound his ear, and rears his head; Bred by Ulysses, nourish'd at his board, But, ah! not fated long to please his lord; To him, his swiftness and his strength were vain; The voice of glory call'd him o'er the main. Till then in every sylvan chase renown'd, With Argus, Argus, rung the woods around; With him the youth pursued the goat or fawn, Or traced the mazy leveret o'er the lawn. Now left to man's ingratitude he lay, Unhoused, neglected in the public way; And where on heaps the rich manure was spread, Obscene with reptiles, took his sordid bed.</p></div> </div>
