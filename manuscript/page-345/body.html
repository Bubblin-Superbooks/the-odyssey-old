The heaven-taught poet and enchanting strain; The well-filled palace, the perpetual feast, A land rejoicing, and a people bless'd! How goodly seems it ever to employ Man's social days in union and in joy; The plenteous hoard high-heap'd with cates divine, And o'er the foaming bowl the laughing wine!</p><p>"Amid these joys, why seels thy mind to know The unhappy series of a wanderer's woe? Rememberance sad, whose image to review, Alas, I must open all my wounds anew! And oh, what first, what last shall I relate, Of woes unnumbered sent by Heaven and Fate?</p></div> </div>
