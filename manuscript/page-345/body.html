The ball dismissed, in dance they skim the strand, Turn and return, and scarce imprint the sand. The assembly gazes with astonished eyes, And sends in shouts applauses to the skies.</p><p>Then thus Ulysses: "Happy king, whose name The brightest shines in all the rolls of fame! In subjects happy with surprise I gaze; Thy praise was just; their skill transcends thy praise."</p><p>Pleas'd with his people's fame, the monarch hears, And thus benevolent accosts the peers: "Since wisdom's sacred guidance he pursues, Give to the stranger-guest a stranger's dues: Twelve princes in our realm dominion share, O'er whom supreme, imperial power I bear; Bring gold, a pledge of love: a talent bring, A vest, a robe, and imitate your king. Be swift to give: that he this night may share The social feast of joy, with joy sincere. And thou, Euryalus, redeem thy wrong; A generous heart repairs a slanderous tongue."</p></div> </div>
