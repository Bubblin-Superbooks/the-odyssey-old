Pleased with her virtuous fears, the king replies: "Indulge, my son, the cautions of the wise; Time shall the truth to sure remembrance bring: This garb of poverty belies the king: No more. This day our deepest care requires, Cautious to act what thought mature inspires. If one man's blood, though mean, distain our hands, The homicide retreats to foreign lands; By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls, The important deed our whole attention calls."</p><p>"Be that thy care (Telemachus replies) The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise; For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey, And dauntless follow where you led the way; Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find Thy coward son degenerate lag behind."</p></div> </div>
