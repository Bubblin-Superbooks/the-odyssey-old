Or waits he grieved, His age not honour'd, nor his wants relieved? Promiscuous grace on all the queen confers (In woes bewilder'd, oft the wisest errs). The wordy vagrant to the dole aspires, And modest worth with noble scorn retires."</p><p>She thus: "O cease that ever-honour'd name To blemish now: it ill deserves your blame, A bowl of generous wine sufficed the guest; In vain the queen the night refection press'd; Nor would he court repose in downy state, Unbless'd, abandon'd to the rage of Fate! A hide beneath the portico was spread, And fleecy skins composed an humble bed; A downy carpet cast with duteous care, Secured him from the keen nocturnal air."</p></div> </div>
