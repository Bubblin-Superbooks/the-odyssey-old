There in the portal placed, the heaven-born maid Enormous riot and misrule survey'd. On hides of beeves, before the palace gate (Sad spoils of luxury), the suitors sate. With rival art, and ardour in their mien, At chess they vie, to captivate the queen; Divining of their loves. Attending nigh, A menial train the flowing bowl supply.</p></div> </div>
