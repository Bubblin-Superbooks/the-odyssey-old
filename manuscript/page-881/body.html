<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Quick through the father's heart these accents ran; Grief seized at once, and wrapp'd up all the man: Deep from his soul lie sigh'd, and sorrowing spread A cloud of ashes on his hoary head. Trembling with agonies of strong delight Stood the great son, heart-wounded with the sight: He ran, he seized him with a strict embrace, With thousand kisses wander'd o'er his face: "I, I am he; O father, rise! behold Thy son, with twenty winters now grown old; Thy son, so long desired, so long detain'd, Restored, and breathing in his native land: These floods of sorrow, O my sire, restrain! The vengeance is complete; the suitor train, Stretch'd in our palace, by these hands lie slain."</p></div> </div>
