To fly these shores the prescient Theban shade And Circe warn! Oh be their voice obey'd Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes: Fly these dire regions, and revere the gods!'</p><p>"While yet I spoke, a sudden sorrow ran Through every breast, and spread from man to man, Till wrathful thus Eurylochus began:</p><p>"'O cruel thou! some Fury sure has steel'd That stubborn soul, by toil untaught to yield! From sleep debarr'd, we sink from woes to woes: And cruel' enviest thou a short repose? Still must we restless rove, new seas explore, The sun descending, and so near the shore? And lo! the night begins her groomy reign, And doubles all the terrors of the main: Oft in the dead of night loud winds rise, Lash the wild surge, and bluster in the skies.</p></div> </div>
