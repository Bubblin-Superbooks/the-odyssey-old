<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of this an ample vase we heaved aboard, And brought another with provisions stored. My soul foreboded I should find the bower Of some fell monster, fierce with barbarous power; Some rustic wretch, who lived in Heaven's despite, Contemning laws, and trampling on the right. The cave we found, but vacant all within (His flock the giant tended on the green): But round the grot we gaze; and all we view, In order ranged our admiration drew: The bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd, The folded flocks each separate from the rest (The larger here, and there the lesser lambs, The new-fallen young here bleating for their dams: The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies); The cavern echoes with responsive cries. Capacious chargers all around were laid. Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store My friends advise me, and to quit the shore.</p></div> </div>
