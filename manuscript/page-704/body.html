<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But your wise lord (in whose capacious soul High schemes of power in just succession roll) His Ithaca refused from favouring Fate, Till copious wealth might guard his regal state. Phedon the fact affirm'd, whose sovereign sway Thesprotian tribes, a duteous race, obey; And bade the gods this added truth attest (While pure libations crown'd the genial feast), That anchor'd in his port the vessels stand, To waft the hero to his natal land. I for Dulichium urge the watery way, But first the Ulyssean wealth survey: So rich the value of a store so vast Demands the pomp of centuries to waste! The darling object of your royal love Was journey'd thence to Dodonean Jove; By the sure precept of the sylvan shrine, To form the conduct of his great design; Irresolute of soul, his state to shroud In dark disguise, or come, a king avow'd! Thus lives your lord; nor longer doom'd to roam;</p></div> </div>
