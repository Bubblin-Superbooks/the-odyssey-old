Soon as warm life its wonted office found, The mindful chief Leucothea's scarf unbound; Observant of her word, he turn'd aside HIs head, and cast it on the rolling tide. Behind him far, upon the purple waves, The waters waft it, and the nymph receives.</p><p>Now parting from the stream, Ulysses found A mossy bank with pliant rushes crown'd; The bank he press'd, and gently kiss'd the ground; Where on the flowery herb as soft he lay, Thus to his soul the sage began to say:</p><p>"What will ye next ordain, ye powers on high! And yet, ah yet, what fates are we to try? Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear, Thus spent already, how shall nature bear The dews descending, and nocturnal air;</p></div> </div>
