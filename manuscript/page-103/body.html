There from the portal, with her mild command, Thus gently checks the minstrel's tuneful hand:</p><p>"Phemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old, What ancient bards in hall and bower have told, Attemper'd to the lyre, your voice employ; Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy. But, oh! forbear that dear disastrous name, To sorrow sacred, and secure of fame; My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound, And every piercing note inflicts a wound."</p><p>"Why, dearest object of my duteous love, (Replied the prince,) will you the bard reprove? Oft, Jove's ethereal rays (resistless fire) The chanters soul and raptured song inspire Instinct divine? nor blame severe his choice, Warbling the Grecian woes with heart and voice;</p></div> </div>
