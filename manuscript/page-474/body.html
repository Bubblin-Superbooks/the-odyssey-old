When hush'd their passion, thus the goddess cries: 'Ulysses, taught by labours to be wise, Let this short memory of grief suffice. To me are known the various woes ye bore. In storms by sea, in perils on the shore; Forget whatever was in Fortune's power, And share the pleasures of this genial hour. Such be your mind as ere ye left your coast, Or learn'd to sorrow for a country lost.</p></div> </div>
