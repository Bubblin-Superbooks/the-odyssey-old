<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease, Return'd Atrides to the coast of Greece, And safe to Argos port his navy brought, With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught. Hence warn'd, my son, beware! nor idly stand Too long a stranger to thy native land; Lest heedless absence wear thy wealth away, While lawless feasters in thy palace away; Perhaps may seize thy realm, and share the spoil; And though return, with disappointed toil, From thy vain journey, to a rifled isle. However, my friend, indulge one labour more, And seek Atrides on the Spartan shore.</p></div> </div>
