<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Here, on his musing mood the goddess press'd, Approaching soft, and thus the chief address'd: "Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey, No more in sorrows languish life away: Free as the winds I give thee now to rove: Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove, And form a raft, and build the rising ship, Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep. To store the vessel let the care be mine, With water from the rock and rosy wine, And life-sustaining bread, and fair array, And prosperous gales to waft thee on the way. These, if the gods with my desire comply (The gods, alas, more mighty far than I, And better skill'd in dark events to come), In peace shall land thee at thy native home."</p></div> </div>
