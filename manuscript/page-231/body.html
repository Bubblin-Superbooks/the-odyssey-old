<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove, Who ruled his subjects with a father's love, Sole in an isle, encircled by the main, Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign, Unbless'd he sighs, detained by lawless charms, And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms. Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey, Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way. And now fierce traitors, studious to destroy His only son, their ambush'd fraud employ; Who, pious, following his great father's fame, To sacred Pylos and to Sparta came."</p><p>"What words are these? (replied the power who forms The clouds of night, and darkens heaven with storms;) Is not already in thy soul decreed, The chief's return shall make the guilty bleed? What cannot Wisdom do? Thou may'st restore The son in safety to his native shore; While the fell foes, who late in ambush lay, With fraud defeated measure back their way."</p></div> </div>
