<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What histories of toil could I declare! But still long-wearied nature wants repair; Spent with fatigue, and shrunk with pining fast, My craving bowels still require repast. Howe'er the noble, suffering mind may grieve Its load of anguish, and disdain to live, Necessity demands our daily bread; Hunger is insolent, and will be fed. But finish, oh ye peers! what you propose, And let the morrow's dawn conclude my woes. Pleased will I suffer all the gods ordain, To see my soil, my son, my friends again. That view vouchsafed, let instant death surprise With ever-during shade these happy eyes!"</p><p>The assembled peers with general praise approved His pleaded reason, and the suit he moved. Each drinks a full oblivion of his cares, And to the gifts of balmy sleep repairs, Ulysses in the regal walls alone Remain'd: beside him, on a splendid throne, Divine Arete and Alcinous shone.</p></div> </div>
