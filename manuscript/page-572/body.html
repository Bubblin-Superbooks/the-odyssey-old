<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A knotty stake then aiming at his head, Down dropped he groaning, and the spirit fled. The scorching flames climb round on every side; Then the singed members they with skill divide; On these, in rolls of fat involved with art, The choicest morsels lay from every part. Some in the flames bestrew'd with flour they threw; Some cut in fragments from the forks they drew: These while on several tables they dispose. A priest himself the blameless rustic rose; Expert the destined victim to dispart In seven just portions, pure of hand and heart. One sacred to the nymphs apart they lay: Another to the winged sons of May; The rural tribe in common share the rest, The king the chine, the honour of the feast, Who sate delighted at his servant's board; The faithful servant joy'd his unknown lord. "Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cried) to Jove, As well thou claim'st a grateful stranger's love!"</p></div> </div>
