<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus spoke the prince; the attending peers obey; In state they move; Alcinous heads the way Swift to Demodocus the herald flies, At once the sailors to their charge arise; They launch the vessel, and unfurl the sails, And stretch the swelling canvas to the gales; Then to the palace move: a gathering throng, Youth, and white age, tumultuous pour along. Now all accesses to the dome are fill'd; Eight boars, the choicest of the herd, are kill'd; Two beeves, twelve fatlings, from the flock they bring To crown the feast; so wills the bounteous king, The herald now arrives, and guides along The sacred master of celestial song; Dear to the Muse! who gave his days to flow With mighty blessings, mix'd with mighty woe; With clouds of darkness quench'd his visual ray, But gave him skill to raise the lofty lay.</p></div> </div>
