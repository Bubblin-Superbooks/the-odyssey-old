And will Omnipotence neglect to save The suffering virtue of the wise and brave? Must he, whose altars on the Phrygian shore With frequent rites, and pure, avow'd thy power, Be doom'd the worst of human ills to prove, Unbless'd, abandon'd to the wrath of Jove?"</p><p>"Daughter! what words have pass'd thy lips unweigh'd! (Replied the Thunderer to the martial maid;) Deem not unjustly by my doom oppress'd, Of human race the wisest and the best.</p></div> </div>
