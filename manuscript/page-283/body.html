<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Though well I see thy graces far above The dear, though mortal, object of my love, Of youth eternal well the difference know, And the short date of fading charms below; Yet every day, while absent thus I roam, I languish to return and die at home. Whate'er the gods shall destine me to bear; In the black ocean or the watery war, 'Tis mine to master with a constant mind; Inured to perils, to the worst resign'd, By seas, by wars, so many dangers run; Still I can suffer; their high will he done!"</p><p>Thus while he spoke, the beamy sun descends, And rising night her friendly shade extends, To the close grot the lonely pair remove, And slept delighted with the gifts of love. When rose morning call'd them from their rest, Ulysses robed him in the cloak and vest.</p></div> </div>
