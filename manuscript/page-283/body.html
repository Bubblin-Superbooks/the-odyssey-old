Lo, to the palace I direct thy way; Where, in high state, the nobles of the land Attend my royal sire, a radiant band But hear, though wisdom in thy soul presides, Speaks from thy tongue, and every action guides; Advance at distance, while I pass the plain Where o'er the furrows waves the golden grain; Alone I reascend--With airy mounds A strength of wall the guarded city bounds; The jutting land two ample bays divides: Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides; The spacious basons arching rocks enclose, A sure defence from every storm that blows. Close to the bay great Neptune's fane adjoins; And near, a forum flank'd with marble shines, Where the bold youth, the numerous fleets to store, Shape the broad sail, or smooth the taper oar: For not the bow they bend, nor boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill;</p></div> </div>
