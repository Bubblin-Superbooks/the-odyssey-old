<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Loud grief resounded through the towers of Troy, But my pleased bosom glow'd with secret joy: For then, with dire remorse and conscious shame I view'd the effects of that disastrous flame. Which, kindled by the imperious queen of love, Constrain'd me from my native realm to rove: And oft in bitterness of soul deplored My absent daughter and my dearer lord; Admired among the first of human race, For every gift of mind and manly grace."</p><p>"Right well (replied the king) your speech displays The matchless merit of the chief you praise: Heroes in various climes myself have found, For martial deeds and depth of thought renown'd; But Ithacus, unrivall'd in his claim, May boast a title to the loudest fame: In battle calm he guides the rapid storm, Wise to resolve, and patient to perform.</p></div> </div>
