When lo! a bright cerulean form appears, Proteus her sire divine. With pity press'd, Me sole the daughter of the deep address'd; What time, with hunger pined, my absent mates Roam the wide isle in search of rural cates, Bait the barb'd steel, and from the fishy flood Appease the afflictive fierce desire of food."</p><p>"'Whoe'er thou art (the azure goddess cries) Thy conduct ill-deserves the praise of wise: Is death thy choice, or misery thy boast, That here inglorious, on a barren coast, Thy brave associates droop, a meagre train, With famine pale, and ask thy care in vain?</p></div> </div>
