A sudden joy in every bosom rose: So will'd some demon, minister of woes!</p><p>"To whom with grief: 'O swift to be undone! Constrain'd I act what wisdom bids me shun. But yonder herbs and yonder flocks forbear; Attest the heavens, and call the gods to hear: Content, an innocent repast display, By Circe given, and fly the dangerous prey.'</p><p>'Thus I: and while to shore the vessel flies, With hands uplifted they attest the skies: Then, where a fountain's gurgling waters play, They rush to land, and end in feasts the day: They feed; they quaff; and now (their hunger fled) Sigh for their friends devour'd, and mourn the dead; Nor cease the tears' till each in slumber</p></div> </div>
