What bounty gives without a rival share; I ask, what harms not thee, to breathe this air: Alike on alms we both precarious live: And canst thou envy when the great relieve? Know, from the bounteous heavens all riches flow, And what man gives, the gods by man bestow; Proud as thou art, henceforth no more be proud, Lest I imprint my vengeance in thy blood; Old as I am, should once my fury burn, How would'st thou fly, nor e'en in thought return!"</p><p>"Mere woman-glutton! (thus the churl replied;) A tongue so flippant, with a throat so wide! Why cease I gods! to dash those teeth away, Like some wild boar's, that, greedy of his prey, Uproots the bearded corn? Rise, try the fight, Gird well thy loins, approach, and feel my might: Sure of defeat, before the peers</p></div> </div>
