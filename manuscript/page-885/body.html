<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>" Swift as the word the parting arrow sings, And bears thy fate, Antinous, on its wings: Wretch that he was, of unprophetic soul! High in his hands he rear'd the golden bowl! E'en then to drain it lengthen'd out his breath; Changed to the deep, the bitter draught of death: For fate who fear'd amidst a feastful band? And fate to numbers, by a single hand? Full through his throat Ulysses' weapon pass'd, And pierced his neck. He falls, and breathes his last. The tumbling goblet the wide floor o'erflows, A stream of gore burst spouting from his nose; Grim in convulsive agonies be sprawls: Before him spurn'd the loaded table falls, And spreads the pavement with a mingled flood Of floating meats, and wine, and human blood.</p></div> </div>
