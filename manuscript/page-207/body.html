Fair hope revives; and eager I address'd The prescient godhead to reveal the rest: 'The doom decreed of those disastrous two I've heard with pain, but oh! the tale pursue; What third brave son of Mars the Fates constrain To roam the howling desert of the main; Or, in eternal shade of cold he lies, Provoke new sorrows from these grateful eyes.'</p><p>"'That chief (rejoin'd the god) his race derives From Ithaca, and wondrous woes survives; Laertes' son: girt with circumfluous tides, He still calamitous constraint abides.
