In an ill-fated hour the coast he gain'd, Where late in regal pomp Thyestes reigned; But, when his hoary honours bow'd to fate, Aegysthus govern'd in paternal state, The surges now subside, the tempest ends; From his tall ship the king of men descends; There fondly thinks the gods conclude his toil: Far from his own domain salutes the soil; With rapture oft the urge of Greece reviews, And the dear turf with tears of joy bedews.</p></div> </div>
