From God's own hand descend our joys and woes; These he decrees, and he but suffers those: All power is his, and whatsoe'er he wills, The will itself, omnipotent, fulfils." This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave; Then pour'd of offer'd wine the sable wave: In great Ulysses' hand he placed the bowl, He sate, and sweet refection cheer'd his soul. The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave (Eumaeus' proper treasure bought this slave, And led from Taphos, to attend his board, A servant added to his absent lord); His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay, And from the banquet take the bowls away. And now the rage of hunger was repress'd, And each betakes him to his couch to rest.</p></div> </div>
