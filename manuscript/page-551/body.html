(Thus quick replied the wisest of mankind) Doubt you my oath? yet more my faith to try, A solemn compact let us ratify, And witness every power that rules the sky! If here Ulysses from his labours rest, Be then my prize a tunic and a vest; And where my hopes invite me, straight transport In safety to Dulichium's friendly court. But if he greets not thy desiring eye, Hurl me from yon dread precipice on high: The due reward of fraud and perjury."</p><p>"Doubtless, O guest! great laud and praise were mine (Replied the swain, for spotless faith divine), If after social rites and gifts bestow'd, I stain'd my hospitable hearth with blood. How would the gods my righteous toils succeed, And bless the hand that made a stranger bleed? No more--the approaching hours of silent night First claim refection, then to rest invite; Beneath our humble cottage let us haste, And here, unenvied, rural dainties taste."</p></div> </div>
