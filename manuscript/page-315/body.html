<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Enough the feast has pleased, enough the power Of heavenly song has crown'd the genial hour! Incessant in the games your strength display, Contest, ye brave the honours of the day! That pleased the admiring stranger may proclaim In distant regions the Phaeacian fame: None wield the gauntlet with so dire a sway, Or swifter in the race devour the way; None in the leap spring with so strong a bound, Or firmer, in the wrestling, press the ground."</p><p>Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey; In state they move, Alcinous lends the way; His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung, High on a column in the palace hung; And guided by a herald's guardian cares, Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.</p></div> </div>
