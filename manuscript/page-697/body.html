And ninety cities crown the sea-born isle: Mix'd with her genuine sons, adopted names In various tongues avow their various claims: Cydonians, dreadful with the bended yew, And bold Pelasgi boast a native's due: The Dorians, plumed amid the files of war, Her foodful glebe with fierce Achaians share; Cnossus, her capital of high command; Where sceptred Minos with impartial hand Divided right: each ninth revolving year, By Jove received in council to confer. His son Deucalion bore successive sway: His son, who gave me first to view the day! The royal bed an elder issue bless'd, Idomeneus whom Ilion fields attest Of matchless deeds: untrain'd to martial toil, I lived inglorious in my native isle. Studious of peace, and Aethon is my name. 'Twas then to Crete the great Ulysses came.</p></div> </div>
