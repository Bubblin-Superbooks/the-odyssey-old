<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hither, intent the rival rout to slay, And plan the scene of death, I bend my way; So Pallas wills--but thou, my son, explain The names and numbers of the audacious train; 'Tis mine to judge if better to employ Assistant force, or singly to destroy."</p><p>"O'er earth (returns the prince) resounds thy name, Thy well-tried wisdom, and thy martial fame, Yet at thy words I start, in wonder lost; Can we engage, not decades but an host? Can we alone in furious battle stand, Against that numerous and determined band? Hear then their numbers; from Dulichium came Twice twenty-six, all peers of mighty name. Six are their menial train: twice twelve the boast Of Samos; twenty from Zacynthus' coast: And twelve our country's pride; to these belong Medon and Phemius, skill'd in heavenly song.</p></div> </div>
