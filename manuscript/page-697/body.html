Till silence thus the imperial matron broke:</p><p>"O why! my son, why now no more appears That warmth of soul that urged thy younger years? Thy riper days no growing worth impart, A man in stature, still a boy in heart! Thy well-knit frame unprofitably strong, Speaks thee a hero, from a hero sprung: But the just gods in vain those gifts bestow, O wise alone in form, and grave in show! Heavens! could a stranger feel oppression's hand Beneath thy roof, and couldst thou tamely stand! If thou the stranger's righteous cause decline His is the sufferance, but the shame is thine."</p></div> </div>
