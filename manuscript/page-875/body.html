Alone, and unattended, let me try If yet I share the old man's memory: If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know (Their light and dearest object long ago), Now changed with time, with absence and with woe." Then to his train he gives his spear and shield; The house they enter; and he seeks the field, Through rows of shade, with various fruitage crown'd, And labour'd scenes of richest verdure round.</p></div> </div>
