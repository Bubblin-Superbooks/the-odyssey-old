Prepare to heir of murder and of blood; Of godlike heroes who uninjured stood Amidst a war of spears in foreign lands, Yet bled at home, and bled by female hands.</p><p>"Now summon'd Proserpine to hell's black hall The heroine shades: they vanish'd at her call. When lo! advanced the forms of heroes slain By stern AEgysthus, a majestic train: And, high above the rest Atrides press'd the plain.</p></div> </div>
