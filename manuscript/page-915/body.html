"Bring sulphur straight, and fire" (the monarch cries). She hears, and at the word obedient flies. With fire and sulphur, cure of noxious fumes, He purged the walls, and blood-polluted rooms. Again the matron springs with eager pace, And spreads her lord's return from place to place. They hear, rush forth, and instant round him stand, A gazing throng, a torch in every hand.</p></div> </div>
