<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Two sister goddesses possess the plain, The constant guardian of the woolly train; Lampetie fair, and Phaethusa young, From Phoebus and the bright Neaea sprung; Here, watchful o'er the flocks, in shady bowers And flowery meads, they waste the joyous hours. Rob not the gods! and so propitious gales Attend thy voyage, and impel thy sails; But if thy impious hands the flocks destroy, The gods, the gods avenge it, and ye die! 'Tis thine alone (thy friends and navy lost) Through tedious toils to view thy native coast.'</p><p>She ceased: and now arose the morning ray; Swift to her dome the goddess held her way. Then to my mates I measured back the plain, Climb'd the tall bark, and rush'd into the main; Then, bending to the stroke, their oars they drew To their broad breasts, and swift the galley flew.</p></div> </div>
