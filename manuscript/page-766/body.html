<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom with thought mature the king replies: "The tongue speaks wisely, when the soul is wise: Such was thy father! in imperial state, Great without vice, that oft attends the great; Nor from the sire art thou, the son, declin'd; Then hear my words, and grace them in thy mind! Of all that breathes, or grovelling creeps on earth, Most man in vain! calamitous by birth: To-day, with power elate, in strength he blooms; The haughty creature on that power presumes: Anon from Heaven a sad reverse he feels: Untaught to bear, 'gainst Heaven the wretch rebels. For man is changeful, as his bliss or woe! Too high when prosperous, when distress'd too low.</p></div> </div>
