That rite complete, uprose the thoughtful man, And thus his meditated scheme began:</p><p>"If what I ask your noble minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in the royal love! Chief, if it hurt not great Antinous' ear (Whose sage decision I with wonder hear), And if Eurymachus the motion please: Give Heaven this day and rest the bow in peace. To-morrow let your arms dispute the prize, And take it he, the favour'd of the skies! But, since till then this trial you delay, Trust it one moment to my hands to-day: Fain would I prove, before your judging eyes, What once I was, whom wretched you despise: If yet this arm its ancient force retain; Or if my woes (a long-continued train) And wants and insults, make me less than man."</p></div> </div>
