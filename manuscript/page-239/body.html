<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When he who thunders rent his bark in twain, And sunk his brave companions in the main, Alone, abandon'd, in mid-ocean tossed, The sport of winds, and driven from every coast, Hither this man of miseries I led, Received the friendless, and the hungry fed; Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe. 'Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove; Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove. Go then he must (he must, if he ordain, Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again); But never, never shall Calypso send To toils like these her husband and her friend. What ships have I, what sailors to convey, What oars to cut the long laborious way? Yet I'll direct the safest means to go; That last advice is all I can bestow."</p></div> </div>
