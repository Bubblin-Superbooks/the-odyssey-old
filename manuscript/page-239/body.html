<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"By Neptune rescued from Minerva's hate, On Gyrae, safe Oilean Ajax sate, His ship o'erwhelm'd; but, frowning on the floods, Impious he roar'd defiance to the gods; To his own prowess all the glory gave: The power defrauding who vouchsafed to save. This heard the raging ruler of the main; His spear, indignant for such high disdain, He launched; dividing with his forky mace The aerial summit from the marble base: The rock rush'd seaward, with impetuous roar Ingulf'd, and to the abyss the boaster bore.</p><p>"By Juno's guardian aid, the watery vast, Secure of storms, your royal brother pass'd, Till, coasting nigh the cape where Malen shrouds Her spiry cliffs amid surrounding clouds, A whirling gust tumultuous from the shore Across the deep his labouring vessel bore.</p></div> </div>
