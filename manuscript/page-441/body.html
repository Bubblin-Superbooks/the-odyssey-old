Astonish'd at the sight, aghast I stood, And a cold fear ran shivering through my blood; Straight I command the sacrifice to haste, Straight the flay'd victims to the flames are cast, And mutter'd vows, and mystic song applied To grisly Pluto, and his gloomy bride.</p><p>"Now swift I waved my falchion o'er the blood; Back started the pale throngs, and trembling stood, Round the black trench the gore untasted flows, Till awful from the shades Tiresias rose.</p><p>"There wandering through the gloom I first survey'd, New to the realms of death, Elpenor's shade: His cold remains all naked to the sky On distant shores unwept, unburied lie. Sad at the sight I stand, deep fix'd in woe, And ere I spoke the tears began to flow.</p></div> </div>
