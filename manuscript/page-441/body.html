How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoin'd, Outfly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind?</p><p>"The ghost replied: 'To hell my doom I owe, Demons accursed, dire ministers of woe! My feet, through wine unfaithful to their weight, Betray'd me tumbling from a towery height: Staggering I reel'd, and as I reel'd I fell, Lux'd the neck-joint--my soul descends to hell. But lend me aid, I now conjure thee lend, By the soft tie and sacred name of friend! By thy fond consort! by thy father's cares! By loved Telemachus' blooming years? For well I know that soon the heavenly powers Will give thee back to-day, and Circe's shores: There pious on my cold remains attend, There call to mind thy poor departed friend. The tribute of a tear is all I crave, And the possession of a peaceful grave.</p></div> </div>
