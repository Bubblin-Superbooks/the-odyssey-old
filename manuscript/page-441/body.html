<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> All day they feast, all day the bowls flow round, And joy and music through the isle resound; At night each pair on splendid carpets lay, And crown'd with love the pleasures of the day. This happy port affords our wandering fleet A month's reception, and a safe retreat. Full oft the monarch urged me to relate The fall of Ilion, and the Grecian fate; Full oft I told: at length for parting moved; The king with mighty gifts my suit approved. The adverse winds in leathern bags he braced, Compress'd their force, and lock'd each struggling blast. For him the mighty sire of gods assign'd The tempest's lood, the tyrant of the wind; His word alone the listening storms obey, To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea.</p></div> </div>
