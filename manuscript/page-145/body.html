Shall I the long, laborious scene review, And open all the wounds of Greece anew? What toils by sea! where dark in quest of prey Dauntless we roved; Achilles led the way; What toils by land! where mix'd in fatal fight Such numbers fell, such heroes sunk to night; There Ajax great, Achilles there the brave, There wise Patroclus, fill an early grave: There, too, my son--ah, once my best delight Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight; In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd A faultless body and a blameless mind; Antilochus--What more can I relate? How trace the tedious series of our fate? Not added years on years my task could close, The long historian of my country's woes; Back to thy native islands might'st thou sail, And leave half-heard the melancholy tale.</p></div> </div>
