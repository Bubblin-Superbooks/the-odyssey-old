<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Meanwhile the god, whose hand the thunder forms, Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heaven with storms: Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps, And night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps. Now here, now there, the giddy ships are borne, And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn. We furl'd the sail, we plied the labouring oar, Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore. Two tedious days and two long nights we lay, O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay. But the third morning when Aurora brings, We rear the masts, we spread the canvas wings; Refresh'd and careless on the deck reclined, We sit, and trust the pilot and the wind. Then to my native country had I sail'd: But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd.</p></div> </div>
