<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains Swift fly the mules; nor rode the nymph alone; Around, a bevy of bright damsels shone. They seek the cisterns where Phaeacian dames Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams; Where, gathering into depth from falling rills, The lucid wave a spacious bason fills. The mules, unharness'd, range beside the main, Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.</p><p>Then emulous the royal robes they lave, And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave (The vestures cleansed o'erspread the shelly sand, Their snowy lustre whitens all the strand); Then with a short repast relieve their toil, And o'er their limbs diffuse ambrosial oil; And while the robes imbibe the solar ray, O'er the green mead the sporting virgins play (Their shining veils unbound). Along the skies, Toss'd and retoss'd, the ball incessant flies. They sport, they feast; Nausicaa lifts her voice, And, warbling sweet, makes earth and heaven rejoice.</p></div> </div>
