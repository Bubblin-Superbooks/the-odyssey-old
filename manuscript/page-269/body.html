There no rude winds presume to shake the skies, No rains descend, no snowy vapours rise; But on immortal thrones the blest repose; The firmament with living splendours glows. Hither the goddess winged the aerial way, Through heaven's eternal gates that blazed with day.</p><p>Now from her rosy car Aurora shed The dawn, and all the orient flamed with red. Up rose the virgin with the morning light, Obedient to the vision of the night. The queen she sought, the queen her hours bestowed In curious works; the whirling spindle glow'd With crimson threads, while busy damsels call The snowy fleece, or twist the purpled wool.</p></div> </div>
