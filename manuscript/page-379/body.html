<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A wondrous net he labours, to betray The wanton lovers, as entwined they lay, Indissolubly strong; Then instant bears To his immortal dome the finish'd snares: Above, below, around, with art dispread, The sure inclosure folds the genial bed: Whose texture even the search of gods deceives, Thin as the filmy threads the spider weaves, Then, as withdrawing from the starry bowers, He feigns a journey to the Lemnian shores, His favourite isle: observant Mars descries His wish'd recees, and to the goddess flies; He glows, he burns, the fair-hair'd queen of love Descends, smooth gliding from the courts of Jove, Gay blooming in full charms: her hand he press'd With eager joy, and with a sigh address'd:</p><p>"Come, my beloved! and taste the soft delights: Come, to repose the genial bed invites: Thy absent spouse, neglectful of thy charms, Prefers his barbarous Sintians to thy arms!"</p></div> </div>
