Retire, while from my wearied limbs I lave The foul pollution of the briny wave. Ye gods! since this worn frame refection know, What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view! But, nymphs, recede! sage chastity denies To raise the blush, or pain the modest eyes."</p><p>The nymphs withdrawn, at once into the tide Active he bounds; the flashing waves divide O'er all his limbs his hands the waves diffuse, And from his locks compress the weedy ooze; The balmy oil, a fragrant shower, be sheds;</p></div> </div>
