<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The table in fair order spread, They heap the glittering canisters with bread: Viands of various kinds allure the taste, Of choicest sort and savour, rich repast! Circe in vain invites the feast to share; Absent I ponder, and absorb'd in care; While scenes of woe rose anxious in my breast, The queen beheld me, and these words address'd:</p><p>"'Why sits Ulysses silent and apart, Some hoard of grief close harbour'd at his heart Untouch'd before thee stand the cates divine, And unregarded laughs the rosy wine. Can yet a doubt or any dread remain, When sworn that oath which never can be vain?'</p><p>"I answered: 'Goddess! human is my breast, By justice sway'd, by tender pity press'd: Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts, To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts.</p></div> </div>
