Thus he; and Nestor took the word: "My son, Is it then true, as distant rumours run, That crowds of rivals for thy mother's charms Thy palace fill with insults and alarms? Say, is the fault, through tame submission, thine? Or leagued against thee, do thy people join, Moved by some oracle, or voice divine? And yet who knows, but ripening lies in fate An hour of vengeance for the afflicted state; When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms.</p></div> </div>
