<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Scarce all my herds their luxury suffice; Scarce all my wine their midnight hours supplies. Safe in my youth, in riot still they grow, Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe. But come it will, the time when manhood grants More powerful advocates than vain complaints. Approach that hour! insufferable wrong Cries to the gods, and vengeance sleeps too long. Rise then, ye peers! with virtuous anger rise; Your fame revere, but most the avenging skies. By all the deathless powers that reign above, By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove (Themis, who gives to councils, or denies Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise), Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe. If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill, Or, having power to wrong, betray'd the will, On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage, And bid the voice of lawless riot rage.</p></div> </div>
