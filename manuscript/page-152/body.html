"O whither, whither flies my son (she cried) To realms; that rocks and roaring seas divide? In foreign lands thy father's days decay'd. And foreign lands contain the mighty dead. The watery way ill-fated if thou try, All, all must perish, and by fraud you die! Then stay, my, child! storms beat, and rolls the main, Oh, beat those storms, and roll the seas in vain!"</p></div> </div>
