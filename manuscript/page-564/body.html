On seven bright years successive blessings wait; The next changed all the colour of my fate. A false Phoenician, of insiduous mind, Versed in vile arts, and foe to humankind, With semblance fair invites me to his home; I seized the proffer (ever fond to roam): Domestic in his faithless roof I stay'd, Till the swift sun his annual circle made. To Libya then he mediates the way; With guileful art a stranger to betray, And sell to bondage in a foreign land: Much doubting, yet compell'd I quit the strand, Through the mid seas the nimble pinnace sails, Aloof from Crete, before the northern gales: But when remote her chalky cliffs we lost, And far from ken of any other coast, When all was wild expanse of sea and air, Then doom'd high Jove due vengeance to prepare.</p></div> </div>
