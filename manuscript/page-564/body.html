As from a hanging rock's tremendous height, The sable crows with intercepted flight Drop endlong; scarr'd, and black with sulphurous hue, So from the deck are hurl'd the ghastly crew. Such end the wicked found! but Jove's intent Was yet to save the oppress'd and innocent. Placed on the mast (the last resource of life) With winds and waves I held unequal strife: For nine long days the billows tilting o'er, The tenth soft wafts me to Thesprotia's shore.</p></div> </div>
