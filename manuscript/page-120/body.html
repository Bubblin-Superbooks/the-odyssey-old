<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pacific now prolong the jovial feast; But when the dawn reveals the rosy east, I, to the peers assembled, shall propose The firm resolve, I here in few disclose; No longer live the cankers of my court; All to your several states with speed resort; Waste in wild riot what your land allows, There ply the early feast, and late carouse. But if, to honour lost, 'tis still decreed For you my bowl shall flow, my flock shall bleed; Judge and revenge my right, impartial Jove! By him and all the immortal thrones above (A sacred oath), each proud oppressor slain, Shall with inglorious gore this marble stain."</p><p>Awed by the prince, thus haughty, bold, and young, Rage gnaw'd the lip, and wonder chain'd the tongue.</p></div> </div>
