Threat on, till all thy stores in waste decay. True, Greece affords a train of lovely dames, In wealth and beauty worthy of our flames: But never from this nobler suit we cease; For wealth and beauty less than virtue please."</p><p>To whom the youth: "Since then in vain I tell My numerous woes, in silence let them dwell. But Heaven, and all the Greeks, have heard my wrongs; To Heaven, and all the Greeks, redress belongs; Yet this I ask (nor be it ask'd in vain), A bark to waft me o'er the rolling main, The realms of Pyle and Sparta to explore, And seek my royal sire from shore to shore;</p></div> </div>
