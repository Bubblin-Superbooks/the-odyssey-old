<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Four friends alone Ulysses' cause embrace, And six were all the sons of Dolius' race: Old Dolius too his rusted arms put on; And, still more old, in arms Laertes shone. Trembling with warmth, the hoary heroes stand, And brazen panoply invests the band. The opening gates at once their war display: Fierce they rush forth: Ulysses leads the way. That moment joins them with celestial aid, In Mentor's form, the Jove-descended maid: The suffering hero felt his patient breast Swell with new joy, and thus his son address'd:</p><p>"Behold, Telemachus! (nor fear the sight,) The brave embattled, the grim front of fight! The valiant with the valiant must contend. Shame not the line whence glorious you descend. Wide o'er the world their martial fame was spread; Regard thyself, the living and the dead."</p></div> </div>
