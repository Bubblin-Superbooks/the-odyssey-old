<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With that the goddess deign'd no longer stay, But o'er the world of waters wing'd her way; Forsaking Scheria's ever-pleasing shore, The winds to Marathon the virgin bore: Thence, where proud Athens rears her towery head, With opening streets and shining structures spread, She pass'd, delighted with the well-known seats; And to Erectheus' sacred dome retreats.</p><p>Meanwhile Ulysses at the palace waits, There stops, and anxious with his soul debates, Fix'd in amaze before the royal gates. The front appear'd with radiant splendours gay, Bright as the lamp of night, or orb of day, The walls were massy brass: the cornice high Blue metals crown'd in colours of the sky, Rich plates of gold the folding doors incase; The pillars silver, on a brazen base; Silver the lintels deep-projecting o'er, And gold the ringlets that command the door.</p></div> </div>
