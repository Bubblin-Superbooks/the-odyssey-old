<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Who then thy master, say? and whose the land So dress'd and managed by thy skilful hand? But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most) Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast? For so reported the first man I view'd (Some surly islander, of manners rude), Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay; Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way. But thou whom years have taught to understand, Humanely hear, and answer my demand: A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave: Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave? Time was (my fortunes then were at the best) When at my house I lodged this foreign guest; He said, from Ithaca's fair isle he came, And old Laertes was his father's name.</p></div> </div>
