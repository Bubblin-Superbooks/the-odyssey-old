The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine With majesty enlarged, and air divine: Back from his brows a length of hair unfurls, His hyacinthine locks descend in wavy curls. As by some artist, to whom Vulcan gives His skill divine, a breathing statue lives; By Pallas taught, he frames the wondrous mould, And o'er the silver pours the fusile gold So Pallas his heroic frame improves With heavenly bloom, and like a god he moves. A fragrance breathes around; majestic grace Attends his steps: the astonished virgins gaze. Soft he reclines along the murmuring seas, Inhaling freshness from the fanning breeze.</p></div> </div>
