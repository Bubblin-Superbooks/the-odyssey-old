Swift as the word, advancing from the crowd, He made obeisance, and thus spoke aloud:</p><p>"Vouchsafes the reverend stranger to display His manly worth, and share the glorious day? Father, arise! for thee thy port proclaims Expert to conquer in the solemn games. To fame arise! for what more fame can yield Than the swift race, or conflict of the field? Steal from corroding care one transient day, To glory give the space thou hast to stay; Short is the time, and lo! e'en now the gales Call thee aboard, and stretch the swelling sails."</p><p>To whom with sighs Ulysses gave reply: "Ah why the ill-suiting pastime must I try? To gloomy care my thoughts alone are free; Ill the gay sorts with troubled hearts agree;</p></div> </div>
