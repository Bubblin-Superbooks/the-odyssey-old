Yet, tatter'd as I look, I challenged then The honours and the offices of men: Some master, or some servant would allow A cloak and vest--but I am nothing now!"</p><p>"Well hast thou spoke (rejoin'd the attentive swain): Thy lips let fall no idle word or vain! Nor garment shalt thou want, nor aught beside, Meet for the wandering suppliant to provide. But in the morning take thy clothes again, For here one vest suffices every swain: No change of garments to our hinds is known; But when return'd, the good Ulysses' son With better hand shall grace with fit attires His guest, and send thee where thy soul desires."</p></div> </div>
