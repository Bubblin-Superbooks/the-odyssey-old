<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So, when by hollow shores the fisher-train Sweep with their arching nets the roaring main, And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain, All naked of their element, and bare, The fishes pant, and gasp in thinner air; Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiffening prey, Till the warm sun exhales their soul away.</p><p>And now the king commands his son to call Old Euryclea to the deathful hall: The son observant not a moment stays; The aged governess with speed obeys; The sounding portals instant they display; The matron moves, the prince directs the way. On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood, All black with dust, and cover'd thick with blood. So the grim lion from the slaughter comes, Dreadful lie glares, and terribly he foams, His breast with marks of carnage painted o'er, His jaws all dropping with the bull's black gore.</p></div> </div>
