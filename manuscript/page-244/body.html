<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Fair hope revives; and eager I address'd The prescient godhead to reveal the rest: 'The doom decreed of those disastrous two I've heard with pain, but oh! the tale pursue; What third brave son of Mars the Fates constrain To roam the howling desert of the main; Or, in eternal shade of cold he lies, Provoke new sorrows from these grateful eyes.'</p><p>"'That chief (rejoin'd the god) his race derives From Ithaca, and wondrous woes survives; Laertes' son: girt with circumfluous tides, He still calamitous constraint abides. Him in Calypso's cave of late! view'd, When streaming grief his faded cheek bedow'd. But vain his prayer, his arts are vain, to move The enamour'd goddess, or elude her love: His vessel sunk, and dear companions lost, He lives reluctant on a foreign coast.</p></div> </div>
