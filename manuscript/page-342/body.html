<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Meanwhile the gods the dome of Vulcan throng; Apollo comes, and Neptune comes along; With these gay Hermes trod the starry plain; But modesty withheld the goddess train. All heaven beholds, imprison'd as they lie, And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the sky. Then mutual, thus they spoke: "Behold on wrong Swift vengeance waits; and art subdues the strong! Dwells there a god on all the Olympian brow More swift than Mars, and more than Vulcan slow? Yet Vulcan conquers, and the god of arms Must pay the penalty for lawless charms."</p><p>Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies, The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries: "Wouldst thou enchain'd like Mars, O Hermes, lie And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?"</p></div> </div>
