<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>' Around thee stand the daughters of the deep, Robe thee in heavenly vests, and round thee weep: Round thee, the Muses, with alternate strain, In ever-consecrating verse, complain. Each warlike Greek the moving music hears, And iron-hearted heroes melt in tears. Till seventeen nights and seventeen days return'd All that was mortal or immortal mourn'd, To flames we gave thee, the succeeding day, And fatted sheep and sable oxen slay; With oils and honey blazed the augmented fires, And, like a god adorn'd, thy earthly part expires. Unnumber'd warriors round the burning pile Urge the fleet coursers or the racer's toil; Thick clouds of dust o'er all the circle rise, And the mix'd clamour thunders in the skies.</p></div> </div>
