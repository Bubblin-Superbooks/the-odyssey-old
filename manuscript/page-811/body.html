<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Heap'd lie the dead without the palace walls-- Haste, daughter, haste, thy own Ulysses calls! Thy every wish the bounteous gods bestow; Enjoy the present good, and former woe. Ulysses lives, his vanquish'd foes to see; He lives to thy Telemachus and thee!"</p><p>"Ah, no! (with sighs Penelope rejoin'd,) Excess of joy disturbs thy wandering mind; How blest this happy hour, should he appear, Dear to us all, to me supremely dear; Ah, no! some god the suitors death decreed, Some god descends, and by his hand they bleed; Blind! to contemn the stranger's righteous cause, And violate all hospitable laws! The good they hated, and the powers defied! But heaven is just, and by a god they died. For never must Ulysses view this shore; Never! the loved Ulysses is no more!"</p></div> </div>
