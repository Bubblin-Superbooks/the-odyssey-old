He said, and high the whirling tripod flung. His shoulder-blade received the ungentle shock; He stood, and moved not, like a marble rock; But shook his thoughtful head, nor more complain'd, Sedate of soul, his character sustain'd, And inly form'd revenge; then back withdrew: Before his feet the well fill'd scrip he threw, And thus with semblance mild address'd the crew:</p><p>"May what I speak your princely minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in this noble love! Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause. If, when the sword our country's quarrel draws, Or if, defending what is justly dear, From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear, The generous motive dignifies the scar.</p></div> </div>
