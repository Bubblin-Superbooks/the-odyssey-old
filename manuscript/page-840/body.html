Ulysses comes! the suitors are no more! No more they view the golden light of day! Arise, and bless thee with the glad survey?"</p><p>Touch'd at her words, the mournful queen rejoin'd: "Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind? The righteous powers, who tread the starry skies, The weak enlighten, and confound the wise, And human thought, with unresisted sway, Depress or raise, enlarge or take away: Truth, by their high decree, thy voice forsakes, And folly with the tongue of wisdom speaks. Unkind, the fond illusion to impose! Was it to flatter or deride my woes? Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy, Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy.</p></div> </div>
