<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"The huge Orion, of portentous size, Swift through the gloom a giant-hunter flies: A ponderous mace of brass with direful sway Aloft he whirls, to crush the savage prey! Stern beasts in trains that by his truncheon fell, Now grisly forms, shoot o'er the lawns of hell.</p><p>"There Tityus large and long, in fetters bound, O'erspreads nine acres of infernal ground; Two ravenous vultures, furious for their food, Scream o'er the fiend, and riot in his blood, Incessant gore the liver in his breast, The immortal liver grows, and gives the immortal feast. For as o'er Panope's enamell'd plains Latona journey'd to the Pythian fanes, With haughty love the audacious monster strove To force the goddess, and to rival Jove.</p></div> </div>
