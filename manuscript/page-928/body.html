The suitor's death, unknown, till we remove Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove."</p><p>Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey, At once they bathe, and dress in proud array: The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance, And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance.</p></div> </div>
