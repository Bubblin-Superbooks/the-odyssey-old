Then thus Euryalus: "O prince, whose sway Rules this bless'd realm, repentant I obey; Be his this sword, whose blade of brass displays A ruddy gleam; whose hilt a silver blaze; Whose ivory sheath, inwrought with curious pride, Adds graceful terror to the wearer's side."</p><p>He said, and to his hand the sword consign'd: "And if (he cried) my words affect thy mind, Far from thy mind those words, ye whirlwinds, bear, And scatter them, ye storms, in empty air! Crown, O ye heavens, with joy his peaceful hours, And grant him to his spouse, and native shores."</p></div> </div>
