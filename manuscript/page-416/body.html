But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie The powers below, the blessed in the sky; Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant, Or magic bind thee cold and impotent.</p><p>"Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant he drew Where on the all-bearing earth unmark'd it grew, And show'd its nature and its wondrous power: Black was the root, but milky white the flower; Moly the name, to mortals hard to find, But all is easy to the ethereal kind. This Hermes gave, then, gliding off the glade, Shot to Olympus from the woodland shade. While, full of thought, revolving fates to come, I speed my passage to the enchanted dome.</p></div> </div>
