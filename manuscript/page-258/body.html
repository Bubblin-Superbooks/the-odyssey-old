But bathe, and, in imperial robes array'd, Pay due devotions to the martial maid, And rest affianced in her guardian aid. Send not to good Laertes, nor engage In toils of state the miseries of age: Tis impious to surmise the powers divine To ruin doom the Jove-descended line; Long shall the race of just Arcesius reign, And isles remote enlarge his old domain."</p><p>The queen her speech with calm attention hears, Her eyes restrain the silver-streaming tears: She bathes, and robed, the sacred dome ascends; Her pious speed a female train attends: The salted cakes in canisters are laid, And thus the queen invokes Minerva's aid;</p></div> </div>
