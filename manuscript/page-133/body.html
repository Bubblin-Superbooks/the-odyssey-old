<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thou to the court ascend: and to the shores (When night advances) bear the naval stores; Bread, that decaying man with strength supplies, And generous wine, which thoughtful sorrow flies. Meanwhile the mariners, by my command, Shall speed aboard, a valiant chosen band. Wide o'er the bay, by vessel vessel rides; The best I choose to waft then o'er the tides."</p><p>She spoke: to his high dome the prince returns, And, as he moves, with royal anguish mourns. 'Twas riot all, among the lawless train; Boar bled by boar, and goat by goat lay slain. Arrived, his hand the gay Antinous press'd, And thus deriding, with a smile address'd:</p><p>"Grieve not, O daring prince! that noble heart; Ill suits gay youth the stern heroic part. Indulge the genial hour, unbend thy soul, Leave thought to age, and drain the flowing bowl. Studious to ease thy grief, our care provides The bark, to waft thee o'er the swelling tides."</p></div> </div>
