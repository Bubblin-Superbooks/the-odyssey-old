When lawless gluttons riot, mirth's a crime; The luscious wines, dishonour'd, lose their taste; The song is noise, and impious is the feast. Suffice it to have spent with swift decay The wealth of kings, and made my youth a prey. But now the wise instructions of the sage, And manly thoughts inspired by manly age, Teach me to seek redress for all my woe, Here, or in Pyle--in Pyle, or here, your foe. Deny your vessels, ye deny in vain: A private voyager I pass the main. Free breathe the winds, and free the billows flow; And where on earth I live, I live your foe."</p><p>He spoke and frown'd, nor longer deign'd to stay, Sternly his hand withdrew, and strode away.</p></div> </div>
