Lest when the Fates his royal ashes claim, The Grecian matrons taint my spotless fame; When he, whom living mighty realms obey'd, Shall want in death a shroud to grace his shade.'</p><p>"Thus she: at once the generous train complies, Nor fraud mistrusts in virtue's fair disguise. The work she plied; but, studious of delay, By night reversed the labours of the day. While thrice the sun his annual journey made, The conscious lamp the midnight fraud survey'd; Unheard, unseen, three years her arts prevail; The fourth her maid unfolds the amazing tale.</p></div> </div>
