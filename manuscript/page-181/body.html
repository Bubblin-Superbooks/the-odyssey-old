<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On the bright eminence young Nestor shone, And fast beside him great Ulysses' son; Grave Eteoneous saw the pomp appear, And speeding, thus address'd the royal ear;</p><p>"Two youths approach, whose semblant features prove Their blood devolving from the source of Jove Is due reception deign'd, or must they bend Their doubtful course to seek a distant friend?"</p><p>"Insensate! (with a sigh the king replies,) Too long, misjudging, have I thought thee wise But sure relentless folly steals thy breast, Obdurate to reject the stranger-guest; To those dear hospitable rites a foe, Which in my wanderings oft relieved my woe; Fed by the bounty of another's board, Till pitying Jove my native realm restored-- Straight be the coursers from the car released, Conduct the youths to grace the genial feast."</p></div> </div>
