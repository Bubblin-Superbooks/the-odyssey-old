<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Heaven such illusion only can impose, By the false joy to aggravate my woes. Who but a god can change the general doom, And give to wither'd age a youthful bloom! Late, worn with years, in weeds obscene you trod; Now, clothed in majesty, you move a god!"</p><p>"Forbear (he cried,) for Heaven reserve that name; Give to thy father but a father's claim; Other Ulysses shalt thou never see, I am Ulysses, I, my son, am he. Twice ten sad years o'er earth and ocean toss'd, 'Tis given at length to view my native coast. Pallas, unconquer'd maid, my frame surrounds With grace divine: her power admits no bounds; She o'er my limbs old age and wrinkles shed; Now strong as youth, magnificent I tread. The gods with ease frail man depress or raise, Exalt the lowly, or the proud debase."</p></div> </div>
