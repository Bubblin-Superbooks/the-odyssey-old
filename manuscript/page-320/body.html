Let fame be his, and ah! my country mine!"</p><p>Meantime Arete, for the hour of rest, Ordains the fleecy couch, and covering vest; Bids her fair train the purple quilts prepare, And the thick carpets spread with busy care. With torches blazing in their hands they pass'd, And finish'd all their queen's command with haste: Then gave the signal to the willing guest: He rose with pleasure, and retired to rest. There, soft extended, to the murmuring sound Of the high porch, Ulysses sleeps profound! Within, released from cares, Alcinous lies; And fast beside were closed Arete's eyes.</p></div> </div>
