Then food supply, and bathe his fainting limbs Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams."</p><p>Obedient to the call, the chief they guide To the calm current of the secret tide; Close by the stream a royal dress they lay, A vest and robe, with rich embroidery gay; Then unguents in a vase of gold supply, That breathed a fragrance through the balmy sky.</p><p>To them the king: "No longer I detain Your friendly care: retire, ye virgin train! Retire, while from my wearied limbs I lave The foul pollution of the briny wave. Ye gods! since this worn frame refection know, What scenes have I surveyed of dreadful view! But, nymphs, recede! sage chastity denies To raise the blush, or pain the modest eyes."</p></div> </div>
