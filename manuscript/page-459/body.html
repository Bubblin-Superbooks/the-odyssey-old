<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"We went, Ulysses! (such was thy command) Through the lone thicket and the desert land. A palace in a woody vale we found Brown with dark forests, and with shades around. A voice celestial echoed through the dome, Or nymph or goddess, chanting to the loom. Access we sought, nor was access denied: Radiant she came: the portals open'd wide: The goddess mild invites the guests to stay: They blindly follow where she leads the way. I only wait behind of all the train: I waited long, and eyed the doors in vain: The rest are vanish'd, none repass'd the gate, And not a man appears to tell their fate.'</p></div> </div>
