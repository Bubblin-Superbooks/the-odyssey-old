<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>With speed Telemachus obeys, and flies Where piled in heaps the royal armour lies; Four brazen helmets, eight refulgent spears, And four broad bucklers to his sire he bears: At once in brazen panoply they shone. At once each servant braced his armour on; Around their king a faithful guard they stand. While yet each shaft flew deathful from his hand: Chief after chief expired at every wound, And swell'd the bleeding mountain on the ground. Soon as his store of flying fates was spent. Against the wall he set the bow unbent; And now his shoulders bear the massy shield, And now his hands two beamy javelins wield: He frowns beneath his nodding plume, that play'd O'er the high crest, and cast a dreadful shade.</p></div> </div>
