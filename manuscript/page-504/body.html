<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Beneath, a gloomy grotto's cool recess Delights the Nereids of the neighbouring seas, Where bowls and urns were form'd of living stone, And massy beams in native marble shone, On which the labours of the nymphs were roll'd, Their webs divine of purple mix'd with gold. Within the cave the clustering bees attend Their waxen works, or from the roof depend. Perpetual waters o'er the pavement glide; Two marble doors unfold on either side; Sacred the south, by which the gods descend; But mortals enter at the northern end. Thither they bent, and haul'd their ship to land (The crooked keel divides the yellow sand). Ulysses sleeping on his couch they bore, And gently placed him on the rocky shore. His treasures next, Alcinous' gifts, they laid In the wild olive's unfrequented shade, Secure from theft;</p></div> </div>
