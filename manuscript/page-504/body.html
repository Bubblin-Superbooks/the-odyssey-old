Then while the night displays her awful shade, Sweet time of slumber! be the night obey' Haste ye to land! and when the morning ray Sheds her bright beam, pursue the destined way.' A sudden joy in every bosom rose: So will'd some demon, minister of woes!</p><p>"To whom with grief: 'O swift to be undone! Constrain'd I act what wisdom bids me shun. But yonder herbs and yonder flocks forbear; Attest the heavens, and call the gods to hear: Content, an innocent repast display, By Circe given, and fly the dangerous prey.'</p></div> </div>
