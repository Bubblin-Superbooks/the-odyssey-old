Yet leave for each of us a sword to wield, A pointed javelin, and a fenceful shield. But by my blood that in thy bosom glows, By that regard a son his father owes; The secret, that thy father lives, retain Lock'd in thy bosom from the household train; Hide it from all; e'en from Eumaeus hide, From my dear father, and my dearer bride. One care remains, to note the loyal few Whose faith yet lasts among the menial crew; And noting, ere we rise in vengeance, prove Who love his prince; for sure you merit love."</p></div> </div>
