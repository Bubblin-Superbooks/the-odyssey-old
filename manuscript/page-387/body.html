Meantime the Cyclop, raging with his wound, Spreads his wide arms, and searches round and round: At last, the stone removing from the gate, With hands extended in the midst he sate; And search'd each passing sheep, and fell it o'er, Secure to seize us ere we reach'd the door (Such as his shallow wit he deem'd was mine); But secret I revolved the deep design: 'Twas for our lives my labouring bosom wrought; Each scheme I turn'd, and sharpen'd every thought; This way and that I cast to save my friends, Till one resolve my varying counsel ends.</p></div> </div>
