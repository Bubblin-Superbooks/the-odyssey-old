<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I stay reluctant seven continued years, And water her ambrosial couch with tears, The eighth she voluntary moves to part, Or urged by Jove, or her own changeful heart. A raft was formed to cross the surging sea; Herself supplied the stores and rich array, And gave the gales to waft me on my way, In seventeen days appear'd your pleasing coast, And woody mountains half in vapours lost. Joy touched my soul; my soul was joy'd in vain, For angry Neptune roused the raging main; The wild winds whistle, and the billows roar; The splitting raft the furious tempest tore; And storms vindictive intercept the shore.</p></div> </div>
