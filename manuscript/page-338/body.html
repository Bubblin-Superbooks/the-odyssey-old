<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Two rows of stately dogs, on either hand, In sculptured gold and labour'd silver stood These Vulcan form'd with art divine, to wait Immortal guardians at Alcinous' gate; Alive each animated frame appears, And still to live beyond the power of years, Fair thrones within from space to space were raised, Where various carpets with embroidery blessed, The work of matrons: these the princes press'd. Day following day, a long-continued feast, Refulgent pedestals the walls surround, Which boys of gold with illuming torches crown'd; The polish'd oar, reflecting every ray, Blazed on the banquets with a double day.</p></div> </div>
