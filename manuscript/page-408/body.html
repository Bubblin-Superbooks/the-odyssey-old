<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>whitens with the rising gale, High at the head, from out the cavern'd rock, In living rills a gushing fountain broke: Around it, and above, for ever green, The busy alders form'd a shady scene; Hither some favouring god, beyond our thought, Through all surrounding shade our navy brought; For gloomy night descended on the main, Nor glimmer'd Phoebe in the ethereal plain: But all unseen the clouded island lay, And all unseen the surge and rolling sea, Till safe we anchor'd in the shelter'd bay: Our sails we gather'd, cast our cables o'er, And slept secure along the sandy shore. Soon as again the rosy morning shone, Reveal'd the landscape and the scene unknown, With wonder seized, we view the pleasing ground, And walk delighted, and expatiate round.</p></div> </div>
