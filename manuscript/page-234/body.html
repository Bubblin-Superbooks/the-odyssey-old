Alike devote to sorrow's dire extreme The day-reflection, and the midnight-dream! Thy son the gods propitious will restore, And bid thee cease his absence to deplore."</p><p>To whom the queen (whilst yet in pensive mind Was in the silent gates of sleep confined): "O sister to my soul forever dear, Why this first visit to reprove my fear? How in a realm so distant should you know From what deep source ceaseless sorrows flow? To all my hope my royal lord is lost, His country's buckler, and the Grecian boast; And with consummate woe to weigh me down, The heir of all his honours and his crown, My darling son is fled! an easy prey To the fierce storms, or men more fierce than they; Who, in a league of blood associates sworn, Will intercept the unwary youth's return."</p></div> </div>
