<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No less a terror, from the neighbouring groves (Rough from the tossing surge) Ulysses moves; Urged on by want, and recent from the storms; The brackish ooze his manly grace deforms. Wide o'er the shore with many a piercing cry To rocks, to caves, the frightened virgins fly; All but the nymph; the nymph stood fix'd alone, By Pallas arm'd with boldness not her own. Meantime in dubious thought the king awaits, And, self-considering, as he stands, debates; Distant his mournful story to declare, Or prostrate at her knee address the prayer. But fearful to offend, by wisdom sway'd, At awful distance he accosts the maid:</p><p>"If from the skies a goddess, or if earth (Imperial virgin) boast thy glorious birth, To thee I bend! If in that bright disguise Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies, Hail, Dian, hail!</p></div> </div>
