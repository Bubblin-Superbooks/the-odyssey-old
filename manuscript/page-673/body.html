My sentence is gone forth, and 'tis decreed Perhaps by righteous Heaven that I must bleed! My father, mother, all I trust to three; To them, to them, transfer the love of me: But, when my son grows man, the royal sway Resign, and happy be thy bridal day!' Such were his words; and Hymen now prepares To light his torch, and give me up to cares; The afflictive hand of wrathful Jove to bear: A wretch the most complete that breathes the air! Fall'n e'en below the rights to woman due! Careless to please, with insolence ye woo! The generous lovers, studious to succeed, Bid their whole herds and flocks in banquets bleed; By precious gifts the vow sincere display: You, only you, make her ye love your prey."</p></div> </div>
