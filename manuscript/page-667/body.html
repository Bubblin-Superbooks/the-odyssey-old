Full well I mark'd the features of his face, Though all unknown his clime, or noble race."</p><p>"And is this present, swineherd! of thy band? Bring'st thou these vagrants to infest the land?

Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings, To share our feast, and lead the life of kings."</p><p>To whom the hospitable swain rejoins: "Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind.

Round the wide world are sought those men divine Who public structures raise, or who design; Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal, Or bless with salutary arts to heal;</p></div> </div>
