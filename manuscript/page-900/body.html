<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Damastor's son, bold Agelaus, leads, The guilty war, Eurynomus succeeds; With these, Pisander, great Polyctor's son, Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon, With Demoptolemus: these six survive: The best of all the shafts had left alive. Amidst the carnage, desperate as they stand, Thus Agelaus roused the lagging band:</p><p>"The hour has come, when yon fierce man no more With bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor; Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast; The four remain, but four against an host. Let each at once discharge the deadly dart, One sure of six shall reach Ulysses' heart: The rest must perish, their great leader slain: Thus shall one stroke the glory lost regain."</p></div> </div>
