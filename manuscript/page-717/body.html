<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Go bathe, and robed in white ascend the towers; With all thy handmaids thank the immortal powers; To every god vow hecatombs to bleed. And call Jove's vengeance on their guilty deed. While to the assembled council I repair: A stranger sent by Heaven attends me there; My new accepted guest I haste to find, Now to Peiraeus' honour'd charge consign'd."</p><p>The matron heard, nor was his word in vain. She bathed; and, robed in white, with all her train, To every god vow'd hecatombs to bleed, And call'd Jove's vengeance on the guilty deed, Arm'd with his lance, the prince then pass'd the gate, Two dogs behind, a faithful guard, await; Pallas his form with grace divine improves: The gazing crowd admires him as he moves.</p></div> </div>
