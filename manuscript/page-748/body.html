<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"May what I speak your princely minds approve, Ye peers and rivals in this noble love! Not for the hurt I grieve, but for the cause. If, when the sword our country's quarrel draws, Or if, defending what is justly dear, From Mars impartial some broad wound we bear, The generous motive dignifies the scar. But for mere want, how hard to suffer wrong! Want brings enough of other ills along! Yet, if injustice never be secure, If fiends revenge, and gods assert the poor, Death shall lay low the proud aggressor's head, And make the dust Antinous' bridal bed."</p><p>"Peace, wretch! and eat thy bread without offence (The suitor cried), or force shall drag thee hence, Scourge through the public street, and cast thee there, A mangled carcase for the hounds to tear."</p></div> </div>
