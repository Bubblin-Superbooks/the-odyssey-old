<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For him the mighty sire of gods assign'd The tempest's lood, the tyrant of the wind; His word alone the listening storms obey, To smooth the deep, or swell the foamy sea. These in my hollow ship the monarch hung, Securely fetter'd by a silver thong: But Zephyrus exempt, with friendly gales He charged to fill, and guide the swelling sails: Rare gift! but O, what gift to fools avails!</p><p>"Nine prosperous days we plied the labouring oar; The tenth presents our welcome native shore: The hills display the beacon's friendly light, And rising mountains gain upon our sight. Then first my eyes, by watchful toils oppress'd, Complied to take the balmy gifts of rest: Then first my hands did from the rudder part (So much the love of home possess'd my heart): When lo! on board a fond debate arose;</p></div> </div>
