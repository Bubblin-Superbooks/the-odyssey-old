<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The shepherd, quitting here at night the plain, Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain; But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear, And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care, So near the pastures, and so short the way, His double toils may claim a double pay, And join the labours of the night and day.</p><p>"Within a long recess a bay there lies, Edged round with cliffs high pointing to the skies; The jutting shores that swell on either side Contract its mouth, and break the rushing tide. Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat, And bound within the port their crowded fleet: For here retired the sinking billows sleep, And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep. I only in the bay refused to moor, And fix'd without, my halsers to the shore.</p></div> </div>
