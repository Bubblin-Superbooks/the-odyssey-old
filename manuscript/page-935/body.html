The secrets of the bridal bed are known To thee, to me, to Actoris alone (My father's present in the spousal hour, The sole attendant on our genial bower). Since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveal'd, Hard and distrustful as I am, I yield."</p><p>Touch'd to the soul, the king with rapture hears, Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears.</p></div> </div>
