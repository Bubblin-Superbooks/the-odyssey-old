<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away! And sleep'st thou careless of the bridal day! Thy spousal ornament neglected lies; Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise! A just applause the cares of dress impart, And give soft transport to a parent's heart. Haste, to the limpid stream direct thy way, When the gay morn unveils her smiling ray; Haste to the stream! companion of thy care, Lo, I thy steps attend, thy labours share. Virgin, awake! the marriage hour is nigh, See from their thrones thy kindred monarchs sigh! The royal car at early dawn obtain, And order mules obedient to the rein; For rough the way, and distant rolls the wave, Where their fair vests Phaeacian virgins lave, In pomp ride forth; for pomp becomes the great And majesty derives a grace from state."</p></div> </div>
