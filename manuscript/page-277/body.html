<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What ships have I, what sailors to convey, What oars to cut the long laborious way? Yet I'll direct the safest means to go; That last advice is all I can bestow."</p><p>To her the power who hears the charming rod; "Dismiss the man, nor irritate the god; Prevent the rage of him who reigns above, For what so dreadful as the wrath of Jove?" Thus having said, he cut the cleaving sky, And in a moment vanished from her eye, The nymph, obedient to divine command, To seek Ulysses, paced along the sand, Him pensive on the lonely beach she found, With streaming eyes in briny torrents drown'd, And inly pining for his native shore; For now the soft enchantress pleased no more; For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms, Absent he lay in her desiring arms, In slumber wore the heavy night away, On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day;</p></div> </div>
