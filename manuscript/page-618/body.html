Can strangers safely in the court reside, 'Midst the swell'd insolence of lust and pride? E'en I unsafe: the queen in doubt to wed, Or pay due honours to the nuptial bed. Perhaps she weds regardless of her fame, Deaf to the mighty Ulyssean name. However, stranger! from our grace receive Such honours as befit a prince to give; Sandals, a sword and robes, respect to prove, And safe to sail with ornaments of love. Till then, thy guest amid the rural train, Far from the court, from danger far, detain. 'Tis mine with food the hungry to supply, And clothe the naked from the inclement sky. Here dwell in safety from the suitors' wrongs, And the rude insults of ungovern'd tongues. For should'st thou suffer, powerless to relieve, I must behold it, and can only grieve. The brave, encompass'd by an hostile train, O'erpower'd by numbers, is but brave in vain."</p></div> </div>
