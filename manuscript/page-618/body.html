<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm, And the fair ranks of battle to deform; Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight, And tempt the secret ambush of the night. Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear, I saw him not, it was not mine to fear. Before the rest I raised my ready steel, The first I met, he yielded, or he fell. But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear, The rural labour, or domestic care. To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing, And send swift arrows from the bounding string, Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind; Those gods, who turn (to various ends design'd) The various thoughts and talents of mankind.</p></div> </div>
