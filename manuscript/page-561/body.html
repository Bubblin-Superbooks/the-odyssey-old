But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear, The rural labour, or domestic care. To raise the mast, the missile dart to wing, And send swift arrows from the bounding string, Were arts the gods made grateful to my mind; Those gods, who turn (to various ends design'd) The various thoughts and talents of mankind. Before the Grecians touch'd the Trojan plain, Nine times commander or by land or main, In foreign fields I spread my glory far, Great in the praise, rich in the spoils of war; Thence charged with riches, as increased in fame, To Crete return'd, an honourable name. But when great Jove that direful war decreed, Which roused all Greece, and made the mighty bleed; Our states myself and Idomen employ To lead their fleets, and carry death to Troy.</p></div> </div>
