<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pensive and pale from grove to grove I stray'd, From the loud storms to find a sylvan shade; There o'er my hands the living wave I pour; And Heaven and Heaven's immortal thrones implore, To calm the roarings of the stormy main, And guide me peaceful to my realms again. Then o'er my eyes the gods soft slumbers shed, While thus Eurylochus arising said:</p><p>"'O friends, a thousand ways frail mortals lead To the cold tomb, and dreadful all to tread; But dreadful most, when by a slow decay Pale hunger wastes the manly strength away. Why cease ye then to implore the powers above, And offer hecatombs to thundering Jove? Why seize ye not yon beeves, and fleecy prey? Arise unanimous; arise and slay! And if the gods ordain a safe return, To Phoebus shrines shall rise, and altars burn.</p></div> </div>
