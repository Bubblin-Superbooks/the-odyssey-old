<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"My queen, my consort! through a length of years We drank the cup of sorrow mix'd with tears; Thou, for thy lord; while me the immortal powers Detain'd reluctant from my native shores. Now, bless'd again by Heaven, the queen display, And rule our palace with an equal sway. Be it my care, by loans, or martial toils, To throng my empty folds with gifts or spoils. But now I haste to bless Laertes' eyes With sight of his Ulysses ere he dies; The good old man, to wasting woes a prey, Weeps a sad life in solitude away. But hear, though wise! This morning shall unfold The deathful scene, on heroes heroes roll'd. Thou with thy maids within the palace stay, From all the scene of tumult far away!"</p></div> </div>
