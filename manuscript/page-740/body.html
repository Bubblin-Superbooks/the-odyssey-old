Observant of the prince's high behest, His menial train attend the stranger-guest; Whom Pallas with unpardoning fury fired, By lordly pride and keen reproach inspired. A Samian peer, more studious than the rest Of vice, who teem'd with many a dead-born jest; And urged, for title to a consort queen, Unnumber'd acres arable and green (Otesippus named); this lord Ulysses eyed, And thus burst out the imposthumate with pride:</p><p>"The sentence I propose, ye peers, attend: Since due regard must wait the prince's friend, Let each a token of esteem bestow: This gift acquits the dear respect I owe; With which he nobly may discharge his seat, And pay the menials for a master's treat."</p></div> </div>
