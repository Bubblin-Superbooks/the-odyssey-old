<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Roused by the hounds' and hunters' mingling cries, The savage from his leafy shelter flies; With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine, And bristles high impale his horrid chine. Young Ithacus advanced, defies the foe, Poising his lifted lance in act to throw; The savage renders vain the wound decreed, And springs impetuous with opponent speed! His tusks oblique he aim'd, the knee to gore; Aslope they glanced, the sinewy fibres tore, And bared the bone; Ulysses undismay'd, Soon with redoubled force the wound repaid; To the right shoulder-joint the spear applied, His further flank with streaming purple dyed: On earth he rushed with agonizing pain; With joy and vast surprise, the applauding train View'd his enormous bulk extended on the plain. With bandage firm Ulysses' knee they bound; Then, chanting mystic lays, the closing wound Of sacred melody confess'd the force;</p></div> </div>
