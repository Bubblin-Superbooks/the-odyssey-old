<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Around the dungeon, studious to behold The hideous pest, my labouring eyes I roll'd; In vain! the dismal dungeon, dark as night, Veils the dire monster, and confounds the sight.</p><p>"Now through the rocks, appall'd with deep dismay, We bend our course, and stem the desperate way; Dire Scylla there a scene of horror forms, And here Charybdis fills the deep with storms. When the tide rushes from her rumbling caves, The rough rock roars, tumultuous boil the waves; They toss, they foam, a wild confusion raise, Like waters bubbling o'er the fiery blaze; Eternal mists obscure the aerial plain, And high above the rock she spouts the main; When in her gulfs the rushing sea subsides, She drains the ocean with the refluent tides; The rock re-bellows with a thundering sound; Deep, wondrous deep, below appears the ground.</p></div> </div>
