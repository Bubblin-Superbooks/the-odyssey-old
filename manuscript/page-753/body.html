<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus anchor'd safe on reason's peaceful coast, Tempests of wrath his soul no longer toss'd; Restless his body rolls, to rage resign'd As one who long with pale-eyed famine pined, The savoury cates on glowing embers cast Incessant turns, impatient for repast Ulysses so, from side to side-devolved, In self-debate the suitor's doom resolved When in the form of mortal nymph array'd, From heaven descends the Jove-born martial maid; And'hovering o'er his head in view confess'd, The goddess thus her favourite care address'd:</p><p>"O thou, of mortals most inured to woes! Why roll those eyes unfriended of repose? Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care; Bless'd in thy queen! bless'd in thy blooming heir! Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow They name the standard of their dearest vow."</p></div> </div>
