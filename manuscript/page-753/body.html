To him, to me, one common lot was given, In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven. Much of his fates I know; but check'd by fear I stand; the hand of violence is here: Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade, And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid. Let for a space the pensive queen attend, Nor claim my story till the sun descend; Then in such robes as suppliants may require, Composed and cheerful by the genial fire, When loud uproar and lawless riot cease, Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace."</p></div> </div>
