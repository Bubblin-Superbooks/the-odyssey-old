Yet what I learn'd, attend; as here I sat, And ask'd each voyager each hero's fate; Curious to know, and willing to relate.</p><p>"Safe reach'd the Myrmidons their native land, Beneath Achilles' warlike son's command. Those, whom the heir of great Apollo's art, Brave Philoctetes, taught to wing the dart; And those whom Idomen from Ilion's plain Had led, securely cross'd the dreadful main How Agamemnon touch'd his Argive coast, And how his life by fraud and force he lost, And how the murderer, paid his forfeit breath; What lands so distant from that scene of death But trembling heard the fame? and heard, admire.</p></div> </div>
