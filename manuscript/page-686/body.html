Seek thou repose: whilst here I sole remain, To explore the conduct of the female train: The pensive queen, perchance, desires to know The series of my toils, to soothe her woe."</p><p>With tapers flaming day his train attends, His bright alcove the obsequious youth ascends: Soft slumberous shades his drooping eyelids close, Till on her eastern throne Aurora glows.</p><p>Whilst, forming plans of death, Ulysses stay'd, In counsel secret with the martial maid, Attendant nymphs in beauteous order wait The queen, descending from her bower of state. Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air.</p></div> </div>
