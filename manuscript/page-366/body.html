<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Ranged in a line the ready racers stand, Start from the goal, and vanish o'er the strand: Swift as on wings of winds, upborne they fly, And drifts of rising dust involve the sky. Before the rest, what space the hinds allow Between the mule and ox, from plough to plough, Clytonius sprung: he wing'd the rapid way, And bore the unrivall'd honours of the day. With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join; The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine. Amphialus sprung forward with a bound, Superior in the leap, a length of ground. From Elatreus' strong arm the discus flies, And sings with unmatch'd force along the skies. And Laodam whirls high, with dreadful sway, The gloves of death, victorious in the fray.</p></div> </div>
