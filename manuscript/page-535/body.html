<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No more my heart the dismal din sustains, And my cold blood hangs shivering in my veins; Lest Gorgon, rising from the infernal lakes, With horrors arm'd, and curls of hissing snakes, Should fix me stiffen'd at the monstrous sight, A stony image, in eternal night! Straight from the direful coast to purer air I speed my flight, and to my mates repair. My mates ascend the ship; they strike their oars; The mountains lessen, and retreat the shores; Swift o'er the waves we fly; the freshening gales Sing through the shrouds, and stretch the swelling sails."</p><p>BOOK XII</p><p>ARGUMENT.</p><p>THE SIRENE, SCYLLA, AND CHARYBDIS.</p></div> </div>
