This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine Enchased with old, this valued gift be thine; To me this present, of Vulcanian frame, From Sidon's hospitable monarch came; To thee we now consign the precious load, The pride of kings, and labour of a god."</p><p>Then gave the cup, while Megapenthe brought The silver vase with living sculpture wrought. The beauteous queen, advancing next, display'd The shining veil, and thus endearing said:</p><p>"Accept, dear youth, this monument of love, Long since, in better days, by Helen wove: Safe in thy mother's care the vesture lay, To deck thy bride and grace thy nuptial day. Meantime may'st thou with happiest speed regain Thy stately palace, and thy wide domain."</p></div> </div>
