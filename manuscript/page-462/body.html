<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The plant I give through all the direful bower Shall guard thee, and avert the evil hour. Now hear her wicked arts: Before thy eyes The bowl shall sparkle, and the banquet rise; Take this, nor from the faithless feast abstain, For temper'd drugs and poison shall be vain. Soon as she strikes her wand, and gives the word, Draw forth and brandish thy refulgent sword, And menace death: those menaces shall move Her alter'd mind to blandishment and love. Nor shun the blessing proffer'd to thy arms, Ascend her bed, and taste celestial charms; So shall thy tedious toils a respite find, And thy lost friends return to human kind. But swear her first by those dread oaths that tie The powers below, the blessed in the sky; Lest to thee naked secret fraud be meant, Or magic bind thee cold and impotent.</p><p>"Thus while he spoke, the sovereign plant</p></div> </div>
