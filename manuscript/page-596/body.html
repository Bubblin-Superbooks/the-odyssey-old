<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Stranger (replied the prince) securely rest Affianced in our faith; henceforth our guest." Thus affable, Ulysses' godlike heir Takes from the stranger's hand the glittering spear: He climbs the ship, ascends the stern with haste And by his side the guest accepted placed. The chief his order gives: the obedient band, With due observance wait the chief's command: With speed the mast they rear, with speed unbind The spacious sheet, and stretch it to the wind. Minerva calls; the ready gales obey With rapid speed to whirl them o'er the sea. Crunus they pass'd, next Chalcis roll'd away, With thickening darkness closed the doubtful day; The silver Phaea's glittering rills they lost, And skimm'd along by Elis' sacred coast. Then cautious through the rocky reaches wind, And turning sudden, shun the death design'd.</p></div> </div>
