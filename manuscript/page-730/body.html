<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look'd guest? That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast! Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn, From every great man's gate repulsed with scorn: To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain, 'Twas but for scraps he ask'd, and ask'd in vain. To beg, than work, he better understands, Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands. For any office could the slave be good, To cleanse the fold, or help the kids to food. If any labour those big joints could learn, Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn. To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread, Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed.</p></div> </div>
