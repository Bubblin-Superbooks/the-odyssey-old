<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Beneath a pile that close the dome adjoin'd, Twelve female slaves the gift of Ceres grind; Task'd for the royal board to bolt the bran From the pure flour (the growth and strength of man) Discharging to the day the labour due, Now early to repose the rest withdrew; One maid unequal to the task assign'd, Still turn'd the toilsome mill with anxious mind; And thus in bitterness of soul divined:</p><p>"Father of gods and men, whose thunders roll O'er the cerulean vault, and shake the pole: Whoe'er from Heaven has gain'd this rare ostent (Of granted vows a certain signal sent), In this blest moment of accepted prayer, Piteous, regard a wretch consumed with care! Instant, O Jove! confound the suitor-train, For whom o'ertoil'd I grind the golden grain: Far from this dome the lewd devourers cast, And be this festival decreed their last!"</p></div> </div>
