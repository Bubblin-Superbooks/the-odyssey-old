<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The chief severe, compelling each to move, Urged the dire task imperious from above; With thirsty sponge they rub the tables o'er (The swains unite their toil); the walls, the floor, Wash'd with the effusive wave, are purged of gore. Once more the palace set in fair array, To the base court the females take their way; There compass'd close between the dome and wall (Their life's last scene) they trembling wait their fall.</p><p>Then thus the prince: "To these shall we afford A fate so pure as by the martial sword? To these, the nightly prostitutes to shame, And base revilers of our house and name?"</p><p>Thus speaking, on the circling wall he strung A ship's tough cable from a column hung; Near the high top he strain'd it strongly round, Whence no contending foot could reach the ground.</p></div> </div>
