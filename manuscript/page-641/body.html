<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The honest herdsman rose, as this he said, And drew before the hearth the stranger's bed; The fleecy spoils of sheep, a goat's rough hide He spreads; and adds a mantle thick and wide; With store to heap above him, and below, And guard each quarter as the tempests blow. There lay the king, and all the rest supine; All, but the careful master of the swine: Forth hasted he to tend his bristly care; Well arm'd, and fenced against nocturnal air: His weighty falchion o'er his shoulder tied: His shaggy cloak a mountain goat supplied: With his broad spear the dread of dogs and men, He seeks his lodging in the rocky den. There to the tusky herd he bends his way, Where, screen'd from Boreas, high o'erarch'd they lay.</p></div> </div>
