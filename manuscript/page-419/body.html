<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"So speaking, from the ruddy orient shone The morn, conspicuous on her golden throne. The goddess with a radiant tunic dress'd My limbs, and o'er me cast a silken vest. Long flowing robes, of purest white, array The nymph, that added lustre to the day: A tiar wreath'd her head with many a fold; Her waist was circled with a zone of gold. Forth issuing then, from place to place I flew; Rouse man by man, and animate my crew. 'Rise, rise, my mates! 'tis Circe gives command: Our journey calls us; haste, and quit the land.' All rise and follow, yet depart not all, For Fate decreed one wretched man to fall.</p></div> </div>
