His meditated fraud I find (Versed in the turns of various human-kind): And, cautious thus: 'Against a dreadful rock, Fast by your shore the gallant vessel broke. Scarce with these few I 'scaped; of all my train, Whom angry Neptune, whelm'd beneath the main, The scattered wreck the winds blew back again.'</p><p>"He answer'd with his deed: his bloody hand Snatch'd two, unhappy! of my martial band; And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor: The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore. Torn limb from limb, he spreads his horrid feast, And fierce devours it like a mountain beast: He sucks the marrow, and the blood he drains, Nor entrails, flesh, nor solid bone remains. We see the death from which we cannot move, And humbled groan beneath the hand of Jove.</p></div> </div>
