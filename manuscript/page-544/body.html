<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Our guilty head We turn'd to flight; the gathering vengeance spread On all parts round, and heaps on heaps lie dead. I then explored my thought, what course to prove (And sure the thought was dictated by Jove): Oh, had he left me to that happier doom, And saved a life of miseries to come! The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced, And low on earth my shield and javelin cast, I meet the monarch with a suppliant's face, Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace, He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side; My state he pitied, and my tears he dried, Restrain'd the rage the vengeful foe express'd, And turn'd the deadly weapons from my breast. Pious! to guard the hospitable rite, And fearing Jove, whom mercy's works delight.</p></div> </div>
