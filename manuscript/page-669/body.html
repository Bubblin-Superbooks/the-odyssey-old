<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such Venus shines, when with a measured bound She smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round, When with the Graces in the dance she moves, And fires the gazing gods with ardent loves.</p><p>Then to the skies her flight Minerva bends, And to the queen the damsel train descends; Waked at their steps, her flowing eyes unclose; The tears she wipes, and thus renews her woes: "Howe'er 'tis well that sleep awhile can free, With soft forgetfulness a wretch like me; Oh! were it given to yield this transient breath, Send, O Diana! send the sleep of death! Why must I waste a tedious life in tears, Nor bury in the silent grave my cares? O my Ulysses! ever honour'd name! For thee I mourn till death dissolves my frame."</p></div> </div>
