So left perhaps to tend the fleecy train, Rude pirates seized, and shipp'd thee o'er the main? Doom'd a fair prize to grace some prince's board, The worthy purchase of a foreign lord."</p><p>"If then my fortunes can delight my friend, A story fruitful of events attend: Another's sorrow may thy ears enjoy, And wine the lengthen'd intervals employ. Long nights the now declining year bestows; A part we consecrate to soft repose, A part in pleasing talk we entertain; For too much rest itself becomes a pain.</p></div> </div>
