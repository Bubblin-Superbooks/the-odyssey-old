O may'st thou, favour'd by some guardian power, Far, far be distant in that deathful hour! For sure I am, if stern Ulysses breathe, These lawless riots end in blood and death."</p><p>Then to the gods the rosy juice he pours, And the drain'd goblet to the chief restores. Stung to the soul, o'ercast with holy dread, He shook the graceful honours of his head; His boding mind the future woe forestalls, In vain! by great Telemachus he falls, For Pallas seals his doom: all sad he turns To join the peers; resumes his throne, and mourns.</p></div> </div>
