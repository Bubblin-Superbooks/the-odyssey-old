<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No want, no famine, the glad natives know, Nor sink by sickness to the shades below; But when a length of years unnerves the strong, Apollo comes, and Cynthia comes along. They bend the silver bow with tender skill, And, void of pain, the silent arrows kill. Two equal tribes this fertile land divide, Where two fair cities rise with equal pride. But both in constant peace one prince obey, And Ctesius there, my father, holds the sway.</p></div> </div>
