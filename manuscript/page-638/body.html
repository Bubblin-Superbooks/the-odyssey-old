<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Fool that I was! I left behind my own, The skill of weather and of winds unknown, And trusted to my coat and shield alone! When now was wasted more than half the night, And the stars faded at approaching light, Sudden I jogg'd Ulysses, who was laid Fast by my side, and shivering thus I said:</p><p>"'Here longer in this field I cannot lie; The winter pinches, and with cold I die, And die ashamed (O wisest of mankind), The only fool who left his cloak behind.'</p><p>"He thought and answer'd: hardly waking yet, Sprung in his mind a momentary wit (That wit, which or in council or in fight, Still met the emergence, and determined right).</p></div> </div>
