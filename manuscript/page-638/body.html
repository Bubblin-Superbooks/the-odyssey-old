Straight to the feastful palace he repair'd, Familiar enter'd, and the banquet shared; Beneath Eurymachus, his patron lord, He took his place, and plenty heap'd the board.</p><p>Meantime they heard, soft circling in the sky Sweet airs ascend, and heavenly minstrelsy (For Phemius to the lyre attuned the strain): Ulysses hearken'd, then address'd the swain:</p><p>"Well may this palace admiration claim, Great and respondent to the master's fame! Stage above stage the imperial structure stands, Holds the chief honours, and the town commands: High walls and battlements the courts inclose, And the strong gates defy a host of foes. Far other cares its dwellers now employ; The throng'd assembly and the feast of joy: I see the smokes of sacrifice aspire, And hear (what graces every feast) the lyre."</p></div> </div>
