Should Jove dire war unloose, with spear and shield, And nodding helm, I tread the ensanguined field, Fierce in the van: then wouldst thou, wouldst thou,--say,-- Misname me glutton, in that glorious day? No, thy ill-judging thoughts the brave disgrace 'Tis thou injurious art, not I am base. Proud to seem brave among a coward train! But now, thou art not valorous, but vain. God! should the stern Ulysses rise in might, These gates would seem too narrow for thy flight."</p></div> </div>
