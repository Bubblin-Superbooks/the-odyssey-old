Hence with those coward terms; or fight or fly; This choice is left you, to resist or die: And die I trust ye shall." He sternly spoke: With guilty fears the pale assembly shook. Alone Eurymachus exhorts the train: "Yon archer, comrades, will not shoot in vain; But from the threshold shall his darts be sped, (Whoe'er he be), till every prince lie dead? Be mindful of yourselves, draw forth your swords, And to his shafts obtend these ample boards (So need compels). Then, all united, strive The bold invader from his post to drive: The city roused shall to our rescue haste, And this mad archer soon have shot his last."</p></div> </div>
