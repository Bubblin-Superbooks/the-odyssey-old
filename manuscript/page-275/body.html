<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>only sweet of life destroy, Did ever goddess by her charms engage A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage? So when Aurora sought Orion's love, Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above, Till, in Ortygia Dian's winged dart Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart, So when the covert of the thrice-eared field Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield, Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms, But Jove's swift lightning scorched him in her arms.</p></div> </div>
