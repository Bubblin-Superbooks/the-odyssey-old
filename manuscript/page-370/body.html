<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Roused by the woodland nymphs at early dawn, The mountain goats came bounding o'er the lawn: In haste our fellows to the ships repair, For arms and weapons of the sylvan war; Straight in three squadrons all our crew we part, And bend the bow, or wing the missile dart; The bounteous gods afford a copious prey, And nine fat goats each vessel bears away: The royal bark had ten. Our ships complete We thus supplied (for twelve were all the fleet).</p><p>"Here, till the setting sun roll'd down the light, We sat indulging in the genial rite: Nor wines were wanting; those from ample jars We drain'd, the prize of our Ciconian wars. The land of Cyclops lay in prospect near: The voice of goats and bleating flocks we hear, And from their mountains rising smokes appear.</p></div> </div>
