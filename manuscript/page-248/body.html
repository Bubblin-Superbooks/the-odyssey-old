With stays and cordage last he rigged the ship, And, roll'd on levers, launch'd her in the deep.</p><p>Four days were pass'd, and now the work complete, Shone the fifth morn, when from her sacred seat The nymph dismiss'd him (odorous garments given), And bathed in fragrant oils that breathed of heaven: Then fill'd two goatskins with her hands divine, With water one, and one with sable wine: Of every kind, provisions heaved aboard; And the full decks with copious viands stored. The goddess, last, a gentle breeze supplies, To curl old Ocean, and to warm the skies.</p></div> </div>
