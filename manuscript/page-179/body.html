<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> While us the works of bloody Mars employ'd, The wanton youth inglorious peace enjoy'd: He stretch'd at ease in Argos' calm recess (Whose stately steeds luxuriant pastures bless), With flattery's insinuating art Soothed the frail queen, and poison'd all her heard. At first, with the worthy shame and decent pride, The royal dame his lawless suit denied. For virtue's image yet possess'd her mind. Taught by a master of the tuneful kind; Atrides, parting for the Trojan war, Consign'd the youthful consort to his care. True to his charge, the bard preserved her long In honour's limits; such the power of song.</p></div> </div>
