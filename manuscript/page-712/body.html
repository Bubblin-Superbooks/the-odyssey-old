Suggest, that Jove the peaceful thought inspired, Lest they, by sight of swords to fury fired, Dishonest wounds, or violence of soul, Defame the bridal feast and friendly bowl."</p><p>The prince, obedient to the sage command, To Euryclea thus: "The female band In their apartments keep; secure the doors; These swarthy arms among the covert stores Are seemlier hid; my thoughtless youth they blame, Imbrown'd with vapour of the smouldering flame."</p></div> </div>
