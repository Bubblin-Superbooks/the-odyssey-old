Here by the stream, if I the night out-wear, Thus spent already, how shall nature bear The dews descending, and nocturnal air; Or chilly vapours breathing from the flood When morning rises?--If I take the wood, And in thick shelter of innumerous boughs Enjoy the comfort gentle sleep allows; Though fenced from cold, and though my toil be pass'd, What savage beasts may wander in the waste? Perhaps I yet may fall a bloody prey To prowling bears, or lions in the way."</p><p>Thus long debating in himself he stood: At length he took the passage to the wood, Whose shady horrors on a rising brow Waved high, and frown'd upon the stream below.</p></div> </div>
