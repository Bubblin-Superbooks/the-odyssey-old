<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With purple clusters blushing through the green. Four limped fountains from the clefts distil: And every fountain pours a several rill, In mazy windings wandering down the hill: Where bloomy meads with vivid greens were crown'd, And glowing violets threw odours round. A scene, where, if a god should cast his sight, A god might gaze, and wander with delight! Joy touch'd the messenger of heaven: he stay'd Entranced, and all the blissful haunts surveyed. Him, entering in the cave, Calypso knew; For powers celestial to each other's view Stand still confess'd, though distant far they lie To habitants of earth, or sea, or sky.</p></div> </div>
