The sovereign seat then Jove born Helen press'd, And pleasing thus her sceptred lord address'd:</p><p>"Who grace our palace now, that friendly pair, Speak they their lineage, or their names declare? Uncertain of the truth, yet uncontroll'd, Hear me the bodings of my breast unfold. With wonder wrapp'd on yonder check I trace The feature of the Ulyssean race: Diffused o'er each resembling line appear, In just similitude, the grace and air Of young Telemachus! the lovely boy, Who bless'd Ulysses with a father's joy, What time the Greeks combined their social arms, To avenge the stain of my ill-fated charms!"</p></div> </div>
