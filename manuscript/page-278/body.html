<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Propitious to my wants a vest supply To guard the wretched from the inclement sky: So may the gods, who heaven and earth control, Crown the chaste wishes of thy virtuous soul, On thy soft hours their choicest blessings shed; Blest with a husband be thy bridal bed; Blest be thy husband with a blooming race, And lasting union crown your blissful days. The gods, when they supremely bless, bestow Firm union on their favourites below; Then envy grieves, with inly-pining hate; The good exult, and heaven is in our state."</p><p>To whom the nymph: "O stranger, cease thy care; Wise is thy soul, but man is bore to bear; Jove weighs affairs of earth in dubious scales, And the good suffers, while the bad prevails. Bear, with a soul resign'd, the will of Jove; Who breathes, must mourn: thy woes are from above.</p></div> </div>
