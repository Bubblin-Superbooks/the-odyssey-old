With ready love her brothers, gathering round, Received the vestures, and the mules unbound. She seeks the bridal bower: a matron there The rising fire supplies with busy care, Whose charms in youth her father's heart inflamed, Now worn with age, Eurymedusa named; The captive dame Phaeacian rovers bore, Snatch'd from Epirus, her sweet native shore (A grateful prize), and in her bloom bestow'd On good Alcinous, honor'd as a god; Nurse of Nausicaa from her infant years, And tender second to a mother's cares.</p></div> </div>
