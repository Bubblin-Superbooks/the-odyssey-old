<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Penelope, to put an end to the solicitation of the suitors, proposes to marry the person who shall first bend the bow of Ulysses, and shoot through the ringlets. After their attempts have proved ineffectual, Ulysses, taking Eumaeus and Philaetius apart, discovers himself to them; then returning, desires leave to try his strength at the bow, which, though refused with indignation by the suitors, Penelope and Telemachus cause it to be delivered to his hands. He bends it immediately, and shoots through all the rings. Jupiter at the same instant thunders from heaven; Ulysses accepts the omen, and gives a sign to Telemachus, who stands ready armed at his side.</p><p>And Pallas now, to raise the rivals' fires, With her own art Penelope inspires Who now can bend Ulysses' bow, and wing The well-aim'd arrow through the distant ring, Shall end the strife, and win the imperial dame: But discord and black death await the game!</p></div> </div>
