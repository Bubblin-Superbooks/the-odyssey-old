<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of gather'd leaves an ample bed he made (Thick strewn by tempest through the bowery shade); Where three at least might winter's cold defy, Though Boreas raged along the inclement sky. This store with joy the patient hero found, And, sunk amidst them, heap'd the leaves around. As some poor peasant, fated to reside Remote from neighbours in a forest wide, Studious to save what human wants require, In embers heap'd, preserves the seeds of fire: Hid in dry foliage thus Ulysses lies, Till Pallas pour'd soft slumbers on his eyes; And golden dreams (the gift of sweet repose) Lull'd all his cares, and banish'd all his woes.</p><p>BOOK VI.</p></div> </div>
