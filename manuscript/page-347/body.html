But if, descended from the Olympian bower, Gracious approach us some immortal power; If in that form thou comest a guest divine: Some high event the conscious gods design. As yet, unbid they never graced our feast, The solemn sacrifice call'd down the guest; Then manifest of Heaven the vision stood, And to our eyes familiar was the god. Oft with some favour'd traveller they stray, And shine before him all the desert way; With social intercourse, and face to face, The friends and guardians of our pious race. So near approach we their celestial kind, By justice, truth, and probity of mind; As our dire neighbours of Cyclopean birth Match in fierce wrong the giant-sons of earth."</p><p>"Let no such thought</p></div> </div>
