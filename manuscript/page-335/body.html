<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For know, from ocean's god Nausithous sprung, And Peribaea, beautiful and young (Eurymedon's last hope, who ruled of old The race of giants, impious, proud, and bold: Perish'd the nation in unrighteous war, Perish'd the prince, and left this only heir), Who now, by Neptune's amorous power compress'd, Produced a monarch that his people bless'd, Father and prince of the Phaeacian name; From him Rhexenor and Alcinous came. The first by Phoebus' hurtling arrows fired, New from his nuptials, hapless youth! expired. No son survived; Arete heir'd his state, And her, Alcinous chose his royal mate. With honours yet to womankind unknown. This queen he graces, and divides the throne; In equal tenderness her sons conspire, And all the children emulate their sire.</p></div> </div>
