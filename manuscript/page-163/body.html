Relate if business, or the thirst of gain, Engage your journey o'er the pathless main Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown The lives of others, venturous of their own."</p><p>Urged by the precepts by the goddess given, And fill'd with confidence infused from Heaven, The youth, whom Pallas destined to be wise And famed among the sons of men, replies: "Inquir'st thou, father! from what coast we came? (Oh grace and glory of the Grecian name!) From where high Ithaca o'erlooks the floods, Brown with o'er-arching shades and pendent woods Us to these shores our filial duty draws, A private sorrow, not a public cause.</p></div> </div>
