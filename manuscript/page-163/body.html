<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On this rough Auster drove the impetuous tide: With broken force the billows roll'd away, And heaved the fleet into the neighb'ring bay. Thus saved from death, the gain'd the Phaestan shores, With shatter'd vessels and disabled oars; But five tall barks the winds and water toss'd, Far from their fellows, on the Aegyptian coast. There wander'd Menelaus through foreign shores Amassing gold, and gathering naval stores; While cursed Aegysthus the detested deed By fraud fulfilled, and his great brother bled. Seven years, the traitor rich Mycenae sway'd, And his stern rule the groaning land obey'd; The eighth, from Athens to his realm restored, Orestes brandish'd the avenging sword, Slew the dire pair, and gave to funeral flame The vile assassin and adulterous dame. That day, ere yet the bloody triumphs cease, Return'd Atrides to the coast of Greece, And safe to Argos port his navy brought, With gifts of price and ponderous treasure fraught.</p></div> </div>
