To that recess, commodious for surprise, When purple light shall next suffuse the skies, With me repair; and from thy warrior-band Three chosen chiefs of dauntless soul command; Let their auxiliar force befriend the toil; For strong the god, and perfected in guile. Strech'd on the shelly shore, he first surveys The flouncing herd ascending from the seas; Their number summ'd, reposed in sleep profound The scaly charge their guardian god surround; So with his battening flocks the careful swain Abides pavilion'd on the grassy plain. With powers united, obstinately bold, Invade him, couch'd amid the scaly fold; Instant he wears, elusive of the rape, The mimic force of every savage shape; Or glides with liquid lapse a murmuring stream, Or, wrapp'd in flame, he glows at every limb.</p></div> </div>
