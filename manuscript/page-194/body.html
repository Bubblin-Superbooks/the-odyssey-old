(Replies the prince) inflamed with filial love, And anxious hope, to hear my parent's doom, A suppliant to your royal court I come: Our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race With lawless riot and misrule disgrace; To pamper'd insolence devoted fall Prime of the flock, and choicest of the stall: For wild ambition wings their bold desire, And all to mount the imperial bed aspire. But prostrate I implore, O king! relate The mournful series of my father's fate: Each known disaster of the man disclose, Born by his mother to a world of woes! Recite them; nor in erring pity fear To wound with storied grief the filial ear. If e'er Ulysses, to reclaim your right, Avow'd his zeal in council or in fight, If Phrygian camps the friendly toils attest, To the sire's merit give the son's request."</p></div> </div>
