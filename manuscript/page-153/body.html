<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Who call'd to council all the Achaian state, But call'd untimely (not the sacred rite Observed, nor heedful of the setting light, Nor herald sword the session to proclaim), Sour with debauch, a reeling tribe the came. To these the cause of meeting they explain, And Menelaus moves to cross the main; Not so the king of men: be will'd to stay, The sacred rites and hecatombs to pay, And calm Minerva's wrath. Oh blind to fate! The gods not lightly change their love, or hate. With ireful taunts each other they oppose, Till in loud tumult all the Greeks arose. Now different counsels every breast divide, Each burns with rancour to the adverse side; The unquiet night strange projects entertain'd (So Jove, that urged us to our fate, ordain'd). We with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd, And brought our captives and our stores aboard; But half the people with respect obey'd The king of men, and at his bidding stay'd.</p></div> </div>
