A deed like this thy future fame would wrong, For dear to gods and men is sacred song. Self-taught I sing; by Heaven, and Heaven alone, The genuine seeds of poesy are sown: And (what the gods bestow) the lofty lay To gods alone and godlike worth we pay. Save then the poet, and thyself reward! 'Tis thine to merit, mine is to record. That here I sung, was force, and not desire; This hand reluctant touch'd the warbling wire; And let thy son attest, nor sordid pay, Nor servile flattery, stain'd the moral lay."</p></div> </div>
