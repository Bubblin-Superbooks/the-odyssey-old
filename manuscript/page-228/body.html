<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ulysses let no partial favours fall, The people's parent, he protected all; But absent now, perfidious and ingrate! His stores ye ravage, and usurp his state."</p><p>He thus: "O were the woes you speak the worst! They form a deed more odious and accursed; More dreadful than your boding soul divines; But pitying Jove avert the dire designs! The darling object of your royal care Is marked to perish in a deathful snare; Before he anchors in his native port, From Pyle re-sailing and the Spartan court; Horrid to speak! in ambush is decreed The hope and heir of Ithaca to bleed!"</p><p>Sudden she sunk beneath the weighty woes, The vital streams a chilling horror froze; The big round tear stands trembling in her eye, And on her tongue imperfect accents die.</p></div> </div>
