<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now, wavering doubt succeeds to long despair; Shall I my virgin nuptial vow revere; And, joining to my son's my menial train, Partake his counsels, and assist his reign? Or, since, mature in manhood, he deplores His dome dishonour'd, and exhausted stores; Shall I, reluctant! to his will accord; And from the peers select the noblest lord; So by my choice avow'd, at length decide These wasteful love-debates, a mourning bride! A visionary thought I'll now relate; Illustrate, if you know, the shadow'd fate:</p><p>"A team of twenty geese (a snow-white train!) Fed near the limpid lake with golden grain, Amuse my pensive hours. The bird of Jove Fierce from his mountain-eyrie downward drove; Each favourite fowl he pounced with deathful sway, And back triumphant wing'd his airy way.</p></div> </div>
