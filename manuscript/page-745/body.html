On me let all your lifted swords descend, And with my life such vile dishonours end."</p><p>A long cessation of discourse ensued, By gentler Agelaus thus renew'd:</p><p>"A just reproof, ye peers! your rage restrain From the protected guest, and menial train: And, prince! to stop the source of future ill, Assent yourself, and gain the royal will. Whilst hope prevail'd to see your sire restored, Of right the queen refused a second lord: But who so vain of faith, so blind to fate, To think he still survives to claim the state? Now press the sovereign dame with warm desire To wed, as wealth or worth her choice inspire: The lord selected to the nuptial joys Far hence will lead the long-contested prize: Whilst in paternal pomp with plenty bless'd, You reign, of this imperial dome possess'd."</p></div> </div>
