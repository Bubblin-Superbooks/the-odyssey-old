<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When great Ulysses shall suppress these harms, Ulysses singly, or all Greece in arms. But if Athena, war's triumphant maid, The happy son will as the father aid, (Whose fame and safety was her constant care In every danger and in every war: Never on man did heavenly favour shine With rays so strong, distinguish'd and divine, As those with which Minerva mark'd thy sire) So might she love thee, so thy soul inspire! Soon should their hopes in humble dust be laid, And long oblivion of the bridal bed."</p><p>"Ah! no such hope (the prince with sighs replies) Can touch my breast; that blessing Heaven denies. Ev'n by celestial favour were it given, Fortune or fate would cross the will of Heaven."</p></div> </div>
