Before his eyes the purple vest he drew, Industrious to conceal the falling dew; But when the music paused, he ceased to shed The flowing tear, and raised his drooping head; And, lifting to the gods a goblet crown'd, He pour'd a pure libation to the ground.</p><p>Transported with the song, the listening train Again with loud applause demand the strain; Again Ulysses veil'd his pensive head. Again unmann'd, a shower of sorrows shed; Conceal'd he wept; the king observed alone The silent tear, and heard the secret groan; Then to the bard aloud--"O cease to sing, Dumb be thy voice and mute the harmonious string;</p></div> </div>
