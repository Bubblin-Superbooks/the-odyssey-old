<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> (By the Delian coast, I voyaged, leader of a warrior-host, But ah, how changed I from thence my sorrow flows; O fatal voyage, source of all my woes;) Raptured I stood, and as this hour amazed, With reverence at the lofty wonder gazed: Raptured I stand! for earth ne'er knew to bear A plant so stately, or a nymph so fair. Awed from access, I lift my suppliant hands; For Misery, O queen! before thee stands. Twice ten tempestuous nights I roll'd, resign'd To roaring blows, and the warring wind; Heaven bade the deep to spare; but heaven, my foe, Spares only to inflict some mightier woe. Inured to cares, to death in all its forms; Outcast I rove, familiar with the storms.</p></div> </div>
