<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With fierce embrace the brawny wrestlers join; The conquest, great Euryalus, is thine. Amphialus sprung forward with a bound, Superior in the leap, a length of ground. From Elatreus' strong arm the discus flies, And sings with unmatch'd force along the skies. And Laodam whirls high, with dreadful sway, The gloves of death, victorious in the fray.</p><p>While thus the peerage in the games contends, In act to speak, Laodamas ascends.</p><p>"O friends (he cries), the stranger seems well skill'd To try the illustrious labours of the field: I deem him brave: then grant the brave man's claim, Invite the hero to his share of fame. What nervous arms he boasts! how firm his tread! His limbs how turn'd! how broad his shoulders spread! By age unbroke!--but all-consuming care Destroys perhaps the strength that time would spare: Dire is the ocean, dread in all its forms! Man must decay when man contends with storms."</p></div> </div>
