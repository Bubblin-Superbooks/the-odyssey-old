<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Beneath, sequester'd to the nymphs, is seen A mossy altar, deep embower'd in green; Where constant vows by travellers are paid, And holy horrors solemnize the shade.</p><p>Here with his goats (not vow'd to sacred fame, But pamper'd luxury) Melanthias came: Two grooms attend him. With an envious look He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:</p><p>"The good old proverb how this pair fulfil! One rogue is usher to another still. Heaven with a secret principle endued Mankind, to seek their own similitude. Where goes the swineherd with that ill-look'd guest? That giant-glutton, dreadful at a feast! Full many a post have those broad shoulders worn, From every great man's gate repulsed with scorn: To no brave prize aspired the worthless swain, 'Twas but for scraps he ask'd, and ask'd in vain. To beg, than work, he better understands, Or we perhaps might take him off thy hands.</p></div> </div>
