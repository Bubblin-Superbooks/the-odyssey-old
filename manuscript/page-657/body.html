If any labour those big joints could learn, Some whey, to wash his bowels, he might earn. To cringe, to whine, his idle hands to spread, Is all, by which that graceless maw is fed. Yet hear me! if thy impudence but dare Approach yon wall, I prophesy thy fare: Dearly, full dearly, shalt thou buy thy bread With many a footstool thundering at thy head."</p><p>He thus: nor insolent of word alone, Spurn'd with his rustic heel his king unknown; Spurn'd, but not moved: he like a pillar stood, Nor stirr'd an inch, contemptuous, from the road: Doubtful, or with his staff to strike him dead, Or greet the pavement with his worthless head. Short was that doubt; to quell his rage inured, The hero stood self-conquer'd, and endured.</p></div> </div>
