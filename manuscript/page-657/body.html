<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Let for a space the pensive queen attend, Nor claim my story till the sun descend; Then in such robes as suppliants may require, Composed and cheerful by the genial fire, When loud uproar and lawless riot cease, Shall her pleased ear receive my words in peace."</p><p>Swift to the queen returns the gentle swain: "And say (she cries), does fear or shame detain The cautious stranger? With the begging kind Shame suits but ill." Eumaeus thus rejoin'd:</p><p>"He only asks a more propitious hour, And shuns (who would not?) wicked men in power; At evening mild (meet season to confer) By turns to question, and by turns to hear."</p></div> </div>
