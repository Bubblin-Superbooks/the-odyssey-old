<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>While fix'd in thought the pensive hero sate, A mendicant approach'd the royal gate; A surly vagrant of the giant kind, The stain of manhood, of a coward mind: From feast to feast, insatiate to devour, He flew, attendant on the genial hour. Him on his mother's knees, when babe he lay, She named Arnaeus on his natal day: But Irus his associates call'd the boy, Practised the common messenger to fly; Irus, a name expressive of the employ.</p><p>From his own roof, with meditated blows, He strove to drive the man of mighty woes:</p><p>"Hence, dotard! hence, and timely speed thy way, Lest dragg'd in vengeance thou repent thy stay; See how with nods assent yon princely train! But honouring age, in mercy I refrain: In peace away! lest, if persuasions fail, This arm with blows more eloquent prevail."</p></div> </div>
