<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But when, from dewy shade emerging bright, Aurora streaks the sky with orient light, Let each deplore his dead; the rites of woe Are all, alas! the living can bestow; O'er the congenial dust enjoin'd to shear The graceful curl, and drop the tender tear. Then, mingling in the mournful pomp with you, I'll pay my brother's ghost a warrior's due, And mourn the brave Antilochus, a name Not unrecorded in the rolls of fame; With strength and speed superior form'd, in fight To face the foe, or intercept his flight; Too early snatch'd by fate ere known to me! I boast a witness of his worth in thee."</p><p>"Young and mature! (the monarch thus rejoins,) In thee renew'd the soul of Nestor shines; Form'd by the care of that consummate sage, In early bloom an oracle of age.</p></div> </div>
