There all his dear companions found their grave! Saved from the jaws of death by Heaven's decree, The tempest drove him to these shores and thee. Him, Jove now orders to his native lands Straight to dismiss: so destiny commands: Impatient Fate his near return attends, And calls him to his country, and his friends."</p><p>E'en to her inmost soul the goddess shook; Then thus her anguish, and her passion broke: "Ungracious gods! with spite and envy cursed! Still to your own ethereal race the worst! Ye envy mortal and immortal joy, And love, the only sweet of life destroy, Did ever goddess by her charms engage A favour'd mortal, and not feel your rage?</p></div> </div>
