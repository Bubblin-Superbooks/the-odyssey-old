<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At this, the chief with transport was possess'd; His panting heart exulted in his breast; Yet, well dissembling his untimely joys, And veiling truth in plausible disguise, Thus, with an air sincere, in fiction bold, His ready tale the inventive hero told:</p><p>"Oft have I heard in Crete this island's name; For 'twas from Crete, my native soil, I came, Self-banished thence. I sail'd before the wind, And left my children and my friends behind. From fierce Idomeneus' revenge I flew, Whose son, the swift Orsilochus, I slew (With brutal force he seized my Trojan prey, Due to the toils of many a bloody day). Unseen I 'scaped, and favour'd by the night, In a Phoenician vessel took my flight, For Pyle or Elis bound; but tempests toss'd And raging billows drove us on your coast. In dead of night an unknown port we gain'd; Spent with fatigue, and slept secure on land.</p></div> </div>
