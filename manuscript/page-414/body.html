<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The cave we found, but vacant all within (His flock the giant tended on the green): But round the grot we gaze; and all we view, In order ranged our admiration drew: The bending shelves with loads of cheeses press'd, The folded flocks each separate from the rest (The larger here, and there the lesser lambs, The new-fallen young here bleating for their dams: The kid distinguish'd from the lambkin lies); The cavern echoes with responsive cries. Capacious chargers all around were laid. Full pails, and vessels of the milking trade. With fresh provisions hence our fleet to store My friends advise me, and to quit the shore. Or drive a flock of sheep and goats away, Consult our safety, and put off to sea.</p></div> </div>
