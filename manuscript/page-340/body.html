(Ulysses straight returns) Whose worth the splendours of thy race adorns, So may dread Jove (whose arm in vengeance forms The writhen bolt, and blackens heaven with storms), Restore me safe, through weary wanderings toss'd, To my dear country's ever-pleasing coast, As while the spirit in this bosom glows, To thee, my goddess, I address my vows; My life, thy gift I boast!" He said, and sate Fast by Alcinous on a throne of state.</p><p>Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares, Portions the food, and each his portion shares. The bard a herald guides; the gazing throng Pay low obeisance as he moves along: Beneath a sculptur'd arch he sits enthroned, The peers encircling form an awful round.</p></div> </div>
