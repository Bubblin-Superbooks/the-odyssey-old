<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With timorous awe From the dire scene the exempted two withdraw, Scarce sure of life, look round, and trembling move To the bright altars of Protector Jove.</p><p>Meanwhile Ulysses search'd the dome, to find If yet there live of all the offending kind. Not one! complete the bloody tale he found, All steep'd in blood, all gasping on the ground. So, when by hollow shores the fisher-train Sweep with their arching nets the roaring main, And scarce the meshy toils the copious draught contain, All naked of their element, and bare, The fishes pant, and gasp in thinner air; Wide o'er the sands are spread the stiffening prey, Till the warm sun exhales their soul away.</p></div> </div>
