<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beneath a table, trembling with dismay, Couch'd close to earth, unhappy Medon lay, Wrapp'd in a new-slain ox's ample hide; Swift at the word he cast his screen aside, Sprung to the prince, embraced his knee with tears, And thus with grateful voice address'd his ears</p><p>"O prince! O friend! lo, here thy Medon stands Ah stop the hero's unresisted hands, Incensed too justly by that impious brood, Whose guilty glories now are set in blood." To whom Ulysses with a pleasing eye:</p><p>"Be bold, on friendship and my son rely; Live, an example for the world to read, How much more safe the good than evil deed: Thou, with the heaven-taught bard, in peace resort From blood and carnage to yon open court: Me other work requires."</p></div> </div>
