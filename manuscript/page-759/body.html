Already in despair he gives it o'er: "Take it who will (he cries), I strive no more, What numerous deaths attend this fatal bow! What souls and spirits shall it send below! Better, indeed, to die, and fairly give Nature her debt, than disappointed live, With each new sun to some new hope a prey, Yet still to-morrow falser than to-day. How long in vain Penelope we sought! This bow shall ease us of that idle thought, And send us with some humbler wife to live, Whom gold shall gain, or destiny shall give."</p><p>Thus speaking, on the floor the bow he placed (With rich inlay the various floor was graced): At distance far the feather'd shaft he throws, And to the seat returns from whence he rose.</p></div> </div>
