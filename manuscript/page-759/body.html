Your own Ulysses! twice ten years detain'd By woes and wanderings from this hapless land: At length he comes; but comes despised, unknown, And finding faithful you, and you alone. All else have cast him from their very thought, E'en in their wishes and their prayers forgot! Hear then, my friends: If Jove this arm succeed, And give yon impious revellers to bleed, My care shall be to bless your future lives With large possessions and with faithful wives; Fast by my palace shall your domes ascend, And each on young Telemachus attend, And each be call'd his brother and my friend. To give you firmer faith, now trust your eye; Lo! the broad scar indented on my thigh, When with Autolycus' sons, of yore, On Parnass' top I chased the tusky boar."</p></div> </div>
