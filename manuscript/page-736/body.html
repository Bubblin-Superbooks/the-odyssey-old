No conscious blush, no sense of right, restrains The tides of lust that swell the boiling veins; From vice to vice their appetites are toss'd, All cheaply sated at another's cost!"</p><p>While thus the chief his woes indignant told, Melanthius, master of the bearded fold, The goodliest goats of all the royal herd Spontaneous to the suitors' feast preferr'd; Two grooms assistant bore the victims bound; With quavering cries the vaulted roofs resound; And to the chief austere aloud began The wretch unfriendly to the race of man:</p><p>"Here vagrant, still? offensive to my lords! Blows have more energy than airy words; These arguments I'll use: nor conscious shame, Nor threats, thy bold intrusion will reclaim. On this high feast the meanest vulgar boast A plenteous board! Hence! seek another host!"</p></div> </div>
