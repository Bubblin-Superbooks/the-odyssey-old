<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some god directing to this peaceful bay Silent we came, and melancholy lay, Spent and o'erwatch'd. Two days and nights roll'd on, And now the third succeeding morning shone. I climb'd a cliff, with spear and sword in hand, Whose ridge o'erlook'd a shady length of land; To learn if aught of mortal works appear, Or cheerful voice of mortal strike the ear? From the high point I mark'd, in distant view, A stream of curling smoke ascending blue, And spiry tops, the tufted trees above, Of Circe's palace bosom'd in the grove.</p><p>"Thither to haste, the region to explore, Was first my thought: but speeding back to shore I deem'd it best to visit first my crew, And send our spies the dubious coast to view.</p></div> </div>
