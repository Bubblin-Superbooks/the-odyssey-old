We sought direction of the power divine: The god propitious gave the guiding sign; Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer, And in Euboea shun the woes we fear. The whistling winds already waked the sky; Before the whistling winds the vessels fly, With rapid swiftness cut the liquid way, And reach Gerestus at the point of day. There hecacombs of bulls, to Neptune slain, High-flaming please the monarch of the main. The fourth day shone, when all their labours o'er, Tydides' vessels touched the wish'd-for shore.</p></div> </div>
