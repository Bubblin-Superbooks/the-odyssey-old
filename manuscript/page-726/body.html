Now did the hour of sweet repast arrive, And from the field the victim flocks they drive: Medon the herald (one who pleased them best, And honour'd with a portion of their feast), To bid the banquet, interrupts their play: Swift to the hall they haste; aside they lay Their garments, and succinct the victims slay. Then sheep, and goats, and bristly porkers bled, And the proud steer was o'er the marble spread.</p></div> </div>
