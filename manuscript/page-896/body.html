With dreadful shouts Ulysses pour'd along, Swift as an eagle, as an eagle strong. But Jove's red arm the burning thunder aims: Before Minerva shot the livid flames; Blazing they fell, and at her feet expired; Then stopped the goddess, trembled and retired.</p><p>"Descended from the gods! Ulysses, cease; Offend not Jove: obey, and give the peace."</p><p>So Pallas spoke: the mandate from above The king obey'd. The virgin-seed of Jove, In Mentor's form, confirm'd the full accord, And willing nations knew their lawful lord.</p></div> </div>
