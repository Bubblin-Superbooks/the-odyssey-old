A tomb along the watery margin raise, The tomb with manly arms and trophies grace, To show posterity Elpenor was. There high in air, memorial of my name, Fix the smooth oar, and bid me live to fame.'</p><p>"To whom with tears: 'These rites, O mournful shade, Due to thy ghost, shall to thy ghost be paid.'</p><p>"Still as I spoke the phantom seem'd to moan, Tear follow'd tear, and groan succeeded groan. But, as my waving sword the blood surrounds, The shade withdrew, and mutter'd empty sounds.</p></div> </div>
