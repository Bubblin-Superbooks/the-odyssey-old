<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Low lies our isle, yet bless'd in fruitful stores; Strong are her sons, though rocky are her shores; And none, ah none no lovely to my sight, Of all the lands that heaven o'erspreads with light. In vain Calypso long constrained my stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; With all her charms as vainly Circe strove, And added magic to secure my love. In pomps or joys, the palace or the grot, My country's image never was forgot; My absent parents rose before my sight, And distant lay contentment and delight.</p><p>"Hear, then, the woes which mighty Jove ordain'd To wait my passage from the Trojan land. The winds from Ilion to the Cicons' shore, Beneath cold Ismarus our vessels bore.</p></div> </div>
