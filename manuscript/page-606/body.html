<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Slave to the insolence of youthful lords! Far hence is by unequal gods removed That man of bounties, loving and beloved! To whom whate'er his slave enjoys is owed, And more, had Fate allow'd, had been bestow'd: But Fate condemn'd him to a foreign shore; Much have I sorrow'd, but my Master more. Now cold he lies, to death's embrace resign'd: Ah, perish Helen! perish all her kind! For whose cursed cause, in Agamemnon's name, He trod so fatally the paths of fame."</p><p>His vest succinct then girding round his waist, Forth rush'd the swain with hospitable haste.</p></div> </div>
