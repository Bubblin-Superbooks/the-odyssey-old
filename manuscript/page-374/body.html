<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Ungenerous were the man, and base of heart, Who takes the kind, and pays the ungrateful part: Chiefly the man, in foreign realms confined, Base to his friend, to his own interest blind: All, all your heroes I this day defy; Give me a man that we our might may try. Expert in every art, I boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill; Should a whole host at once discharge the bow, My well-aim'd shaft with death prevents the foe: Alone superior in the field of Troy, Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly.</p></div> </div>
