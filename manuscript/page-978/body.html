Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest, His people blessing, by his people bless'd. Let all be peace."--He said, and gave the nod That binds the Fates; the sanction of the god And prompt to execute the eternal will, Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill.</p><p>Now sat Ulysses at the rural feast The rage of hunger and of thirst repress'd: To watch the foe a trusty spy he sent: A son of Dolius on the message went, Stood in the way, and at a glance beheld The foe approach, embattled on the field. With backward step he hastens to the bower, And tells the news. They arm with all their power.</p></div> </div>
