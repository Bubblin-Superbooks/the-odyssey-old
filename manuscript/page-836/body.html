<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Jove, and eternal thrones! with heaven to friend, If the long series of my woes shall end; Of human race now rising from repose, Let one a blissful omen here disclose; And, to confirm my faith, propitious Jove! Vouchsafe the sanction of a sign above."</p><p>Whilst lowly thus the chief adoring bows, The pitying god his guardian aid avows. Loud from a sapphire sky his thunder sounds; With springing hope the hero's heart rebounds. Soon, with consummate joy to crown his prayer, An omen'd voice invades his ravish'd ear.</p></div> </div>
