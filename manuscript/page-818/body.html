Active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil At every point their master's rigid will; First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound, Then straighten'd cords involved his body round; So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied, The howling felon swung from side to side.</p><p>Eumaeus scoffing then with keen disdain: "There pass thy pleasing night, O gentle swain! On that soft pillow, from that envied height, First may'st thou see the springing dawn of light; So timely rise, when morning streaks the east, To drive thy victims to the suitors' feast."</p></div> </div>
