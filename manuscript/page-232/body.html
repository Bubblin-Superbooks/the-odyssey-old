Go, to the nymph be these our orders borne 'Tis Jove's decree, Ulysses shall return: The patient man shall view his old abodes, Nor helped by mortal hand, nor guiding gods In twice ten days shall fertile Scheria find, Alone, and floating to the wave and wind. The bold Phaecians there, whose haughty line Is mixed with gods, half human, half divine, The chief shall honour as some heavenly guest, And swift transport him to his place of rest, His vessels loaded with a plenteous store Of brass, of vestures, and resplendent ore (A richer prize than if his joyful isle Received him charged with Ilion's noble spoil), His friends, his country, he shall see, though late: Such is our sovereign will, and such is fate."</p></div> </div>
