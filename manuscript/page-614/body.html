Arrived, with wild tumultuous noise they sate, Recumbent on the shining thrones of state.</p><p>The Medon, conscious of their dire debates, The murderous counsel to the queen relates. Touch'd at the dreadful story, she descends: Her hasty steps a damsel train attends. Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Sudden before the rival powers she stands; And, veiling, decent, with a modest shade Her cheek, indignant to Antinous said:</p><p>"O void of faith! of all bad men the worst! Renown'd for wisdom, by the abuse accursed! Mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind: Thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind. Wretch! to destroy a prince that friendship gives, While in his guest his murderer he receives; Nor dread superior Jove, to whom belong The cause of suppliants, and revenge of wrong.</p></div> </div>
