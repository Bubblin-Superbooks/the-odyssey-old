E'en from the chief whom men and nations knew, The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew; In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o'er, Then hasty enter'd at the lofty door. Night now approaching, in the palace stand, With goblets crown'd, the rulers of the land; Prepared for rest, and offering to the god Who bears the virtue of the sleepy rod, Unseen he glided through the joyous crowd, With darkness circled, and an ambient cloud. Direct to great Alcinous' throne he came, And prostrate fell before the imperial dame. Then from around him dropp'd the veil of night; Sudden he shines, and manifest to sight. The nobles gaze, with awful fear oppress'd; Silent they gaze, and eye the godlike guest.</p></div> </div>
