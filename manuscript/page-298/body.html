<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And now, as near approaching as the sound Of human voice the listening ear may wound, Amidst the rocks he heard a hollow roar Of murmuring surges breaking on the shore; Nor peaceful port was there, nor winding bay, To shield the vessel from the rolling sea, But cliffs and shaggy shores, a dreadful sight! All rough with rocks, with foamy billows white. Fear seized his slacken'd limbs and beating heart, As thus he communed with his soul apart;</p><p>"Ah me! when, o'er a length of waters toss'd, These eyes at last behold the unhoped-for coast, No port receives me from the angry main, But the loud deeps demand me back again. Above, sharp rocks forbid access; around Roar the wild waves; beneath, is sea profound! No footing sure affords the faithless sand, To stem too rapid, and too deep to stand.</p></div> </div>
