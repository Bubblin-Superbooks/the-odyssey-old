<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Patroclus, fill an early grave: There, too, my son--ah, once my best delight Once swift of foot, and terrible in fight; In whom stern courage with soft virtue join'd A faultless body and a blameless mind; Antilochus--What more can I relate? How trace the tedious series of our fate? Not added years on years my task could close, The long historian of my country's woes; Back to thy native islands might'st thou sail, And leave half-heard the melancholy tale. Nine painful years on that detested shore; What stratagems we form'd, what toils we bore! Still labouring on, till scarce at last we found Great Jove propitious, and our conquest crown'd. Far o'er the rest thy mighty father shined, In wit, in prudence, and in force of mind.</p></div> </div>
