<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So shall thy godlike father, toss'd in vain Through all the dangers of the boundless main, Arrive (or if perchance already come) From slaughter'd gluttons to release the dome."</p><p>"Oh! if this promised bliss by thundering Jove (The prince replied) stand fix'd in fate above; To thee, as to some god, I'll temples raise. And crown thy altars with the costly blaze."</p><p>He said; and bending o'er his chariot, flung Athwart the fiery steeds the smarting thong; The bounding shafts upon the harness play, Till night descending intercepts the way. To Diocles at Pherae they repair, Whose boasted sire was sacred Alpheus' heir; With him all night the youthful stranger stay'd, Nor found the hospitable rites unpaid, But soon as morning from her orient bed Had tinged the mountains with her earliest red, They join'd the steeds, and on the chariot sprung, The brazen portals in their passage rung.</p></div> </div>
