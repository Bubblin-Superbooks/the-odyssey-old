<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus speaking, on the right up-soar'd in air The hawk, Apollo's swift-wing'd messenger: His dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove; The clotted feathers, scatter'd from above, Between the hero and the vessel pour Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower.</p><p>The observing augur took the prince aside, Seized by the hand, and thus prophetic cried: "Yon bird, that dexter cuts the aerial road, Rose ominous, nor flies without a god: No race but thine shall Ithaca obey, To thine, for ages, Heaven decrees the sway."</p><p>"Succeed the omens, gods! (the youth rejoin'd:) Soon shall my bounties speak a grateful mind, And soon each envied happiness attend The man who calls Telemachus his friend." Then to Peiraeus: "Thou whom time has proved A faithful servant, by thy prince beloved! Till we returning shall our guest demand, Accept this charge with honour, at our hand."</p></div> </div>
