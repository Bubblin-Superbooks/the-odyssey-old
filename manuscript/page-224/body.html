<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Meanwhile, in Ithaca, the suitor powers In active games divide their jovial hours; In areas varied with mosaic art, Some whirl the disk, and some the javelin dart, Aside, sequester'd from the vast resort, Antinous sole spectator of the sport; With great Eurymachus, of worth confess'd, And high descent, superior to the rest; Whom young Noemon lowly thus address'd:--</p><p>"My ship, equipp'd within the neighboring port, The prince, departing for the Pylian court, Requested for his speed; but, courteous, say When steers he home, or why this long delay? For Elis I should sail with utmost speed. To import twelve mares which there luxurious feed, And twelve young mules, a strong laborious race, New to the plow, unpractised in the trace."</p></div> </div>
