Do public or domestic care constrain This toilsome voyage o'er the surgy main?"</p><p>"O highly-flavour'd delegate of Jove! (Replies the prince) inflamed with filial love, And anxious hope, to hear my parent's doom, A suppliant to your royal court I come: Our sovereign seat a lewd usurping race With lawless riot and misrule disgrace; To pamper'd insolence devoted fall Prime of the flock, and choicest of the stall: For wild ambition wings their bold desire, And all to mount the imperial bed aspire.</p></div> </div>
