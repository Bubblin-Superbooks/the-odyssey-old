All crowded round, the family appears With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears. Swift from above descends the royal fair (Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air); Hangs o'er her son, in his embraces dies; Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes: Few words she spoke, though much she had to say; And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way.</p><p>"Light of my eyes: he comes! unhoped-for joy! Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy? So snatch'd from all our cares!--Tell, hast thou known Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own."</p></div> </div>
