Then disarray'd, the shining bath they sought (With unguents smooth) of polish'd marble wrought: Obedient handmaids with assistant toil Supply the limpid wave, and fragrant oil: Then o'er their limbs refulgent robes they threw, And fresh from bathing to their seats withdrew. The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings, Replenish'd from the pure translucent springs; With copious streams that golden ewer supplies A silver layer of capacious size. They wash: the table, in fair order spread, Is piled with viands and the strength of bread. Full opposite, before the folding gate, The pensive mother sits in humble state; Lowly she sate, and with dejected view The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew. The prince and stranger shared the genial feast, Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased.</p></div> </div>
