At length recovering, to his arms she flew, And strain'd him close, as to his breast she grew. The tears pour'd down amain, and "O (she cries) Let not against thy spouse thine anger rise! O versed in every, turn of human art, Forgive the weakness of a woman's heart! The righteous powers, that mortal lot dispose, Decree us to sustain a length of woes. And from the flower of life the bliss deny To bloom together, fade away, and die.</p></div> </div>
