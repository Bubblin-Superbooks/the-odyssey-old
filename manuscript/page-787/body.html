<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The prince, obedient to the sage command, To Euryclea thus: "The female band In their apartments keep; secure the doors; These swarthy arms among the covert stores Are seemlier hid; my thoughtless youth they blame, Imbrown'd with vapour of the smouldering flame."</p><p>"In happier hour (pleased Euryclea cries), Tutour'd by early woes, grow early wise; Inspect with sharpen'd sight, and frugal care, Your patrimonial wealth, a prudent heir. But who the lighted taper will provide (The female train retired) your toils to guide?"</p><p>"Without infringing hospitable right, This guest (he cried) shall bear the guiding light: I cheer no lazy vagrants with repast; They share the meal that earn it ere they taste."</p></div> </div>
