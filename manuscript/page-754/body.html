This hostile crew What single arm hath prowess to subdue? Or if, by Jove's and thy auxiliar aid, They're doom'd to bleed; O say, celestial maid! Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain Nations embattled to revenge the slain?"</p><p>"Oh impotence of faith! (Minerva cries,) If man on frail unknowing man relies, Doubt you the gods? Lo, Pallas' self descends, Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends. In me affianced, fortify thy breast, Though myriads leagued thy rightful claim contest My sure divinity shall bear the shield, And edge thy sword to reap the glorious field. Now, pay the debt to craving nature due, Her faded powers with balmy rest renew."</p></div> </div>
