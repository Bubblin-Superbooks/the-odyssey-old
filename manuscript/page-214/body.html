<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"My quick return (young Ithacus rejoin'd), Damps the warm wishes of my raptured mind; Did not my fate my needful haste constrain, Charm'd by your speech so graceful and humane, Lost in delight the circling year would roll, While deep attention fix'd my listening soul. But now to Pyle permit my destined way, My loved associates chide my long delay: In dear remembrance of your royal grace, I take the present of the promised vase; The coursers, for the champaign sports retain; That gift our barren rocks will render vain: Horrid with cliffs, our meagre land allows Thin herbage for the mountain goat to browse, But neither mead nor plain supplies, to feed The sprightly courser, or indulge his speed: To sea-surrounded realms the gods assign Small tract of fertile lawn, the least to mine."</p></div> </div>
