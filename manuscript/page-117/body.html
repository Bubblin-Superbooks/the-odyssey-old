Minerva's anger, and the dreadful woes Which voyaging from Troy the victors bore, While storms vindictive intercept the store. The shrilling airs the vaulted roof rebounds, Reflecting to the queen the silver sounds. With grief renew'd the weeping fair descends; Their sovereign's step a virgin train attends: A veil, of richest texture wrought, she wears, And silent to the joyous hall repairs. There from the portal, with her mild command, Thus gently checks the minstrel's tuneful hand:</p><p>"Phemius! let acts of gods, and heroes old, What ancient bards in hall and bower have told, Attemper'd to the lyre, your voice employ; Such the pleased ear will drink with silent joy. But, oh! forbear that dear disastrous name, To sorrow sacred, and secure of fame; My bleeding bosom sickens at the sound, And every piercing note inflicts a wound."</p></div> </div>
