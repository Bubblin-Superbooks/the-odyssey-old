Eumaeus watchful eyed, And thus address'd Ulysses near his side:</p><p>"The miscreant we suspected takes that way; Him, if this arm be powerful, shall I slay? Or drive him hither, to receive the meed From thy own hand, of this detested deed?"</p><p>"Not so (replied Ulysses); leave him there, For us sufficient is another care; Within the structure of this palace wall To keep enclosed his masters till they fall. Go you, and seize the felon; backward bind His arms and legs, and fix a plank behind: On this his body by strong cords extend, And on a column near the roof suspend: So studied tortures his vile days shall end."</p></div> </div>
