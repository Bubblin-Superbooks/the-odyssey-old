In rolling flood, Now here, now there, impell'd the floating wood As when a heap of gather'd thorns is cast, Now to, now fro, before the autumnal blast; Together clung, it rolls around the field; So roll'd the float, and so its texture held: And now the south, and now the north, bear sway, And now the east the foamy floods obey, And now the west wind whirls it o'er the sea.</p></div> </div>
