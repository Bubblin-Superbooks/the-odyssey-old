Not the lost nuptials can affect me more (For Greece has beauteous dames on every shore), But baffled thus! confess'd so far below Ulysses' strength, as not to bend his bow! How shall all ages our attempt deride! Our weakness scorn!" Antinous thus replied:</p><p>"Not so, Eurymachus: that no man draws The wondrous bow, attend another cause.

Now bid the sewer approach, and let us join In due libations, and in rites divine, So end our night: before the day shall spring, The choicest offerings let Melanthius bring: Let then to Phoebus' name the fatted thighs Feed the rich smokes high curling to the skies. So shall the patron of these arts bestow (For his the gift) the skill to bend the bow."</p></div> </div>
