At the cool cave arrived, they took their state; He filled the throne where Mercury had sate. For him the nymph a rich repast ordains, Such as the mortal life of man sustains; Before herself were placed the the cates divine, Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine. Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress'd, Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:</p><p>"Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;) O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man!
