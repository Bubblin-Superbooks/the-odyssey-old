Not more thy wisdom than her virtue shined; Not more thy patience than her constant mind. Icarius' daughter, glory of the past, And model to the future age, shall last: The gods, to honour her fair fame, shall rise (Their great reward) a poet in her praise. Not such, O Tyndarus! thy daughter's deed, By whose dire hand her king and husband bled; Her shall the Muse to infamy prolong, Example dread, and theme of tragic song! The general sex shall suffer in her shame, And e'en the best that bears a woman's name."</p><p>Thus in the regions of eternal shade Conferr'd the mournful phantoms of the dead; While from the town, Ulysses and his band Pass'd to Laertes' cultivated land.</p></div> </div>
