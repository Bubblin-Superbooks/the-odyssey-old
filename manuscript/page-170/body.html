<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then (so Heaven decreed) Ulysses first and Neator disagreed! Wise as he was, by various counsels away'd, He there, though late, to please the monarch, stay'd. But I, determined, stem the foamy floods, Warn'd of the coming fury of the gods. With us, Tydides fear'd, and urged his haste: And Menelads came, but came the last, He join'd our vessels in the Lesbian bay, While yet we doubted of our watery way; If to the right to urge the pilot's toil (The safer road), beside the Psyrian isle; Or the straight course to rocky Chios plough, And anchor under Mimas' shaggy brow? We sought direction of the power divine: The god propitious gave the guiding sign; Through the mid seas he bid our navy steer, And in Euboea shun the woes we fear.</p></div> </div>
