<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Leiodes first before the victor falls: The wretched augur thus for mercy calls: "Oh gracious hear, nor let thy suppliant bleed; Still undishonoured, or by word or deed, Thy house, for me remains; by me repress'd Full oft was check'd the injustice of the rest: Averse they heard me when I counselled well, Their hearts were harden'd, and they justly fell. O spare an augur's consecrated head, Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead."</p><p>"Priest as thou art! for that detested band Thy lying prophecies deceived the land; Against Ulysses have thy vows been made, For them thy daily orisons were paid: Yet more, e'en to our bed thy pride aspires: One common crime one common fate requires."</p></div> </div>
