Then by his heralds, restless of delay, To council calls the peers: the peers obey. Soon as in solemn form the assembly sate, From his high dome himself descends in state. Bright in his hand a ponderous javelin shined; Two dogs, a faithful guard, attend behind; Pallas with grace divine his form improves, And gazing crowds admire him as he moves,</p><p>His father's throne he fill'd; while distant stood The hoary peers, and aged wisdom bow'd.</p><p>'Twas silence all. At last AEgyptius spoke; AEgyptius, by his age and sorrow broke; A length of days his soul with prudence crown'd, A length of days had bent him to the ground.</p></div> </div>
