<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Beds of all various herbs, for ever green, In beauteous order terminate the scene.</p><p>Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crown'd This through the gardens leads its streams around Visits each plant, and waters all the ground; While that in pipes beneath the palace flows, And thence its current on the town bestows: To various use their various streams they bring, The people one, and one supplies the king.</p><p>Such were the glories which the gods ordain'd, To grace Alcinous, and his happy land. E'en from the chief whom men and nations knew, The unwonted scene surprise and rapture drew; In pleasing thought he ran the prospect o'er, Then hasty enter'd at the lofty door.</p></div> </div>
