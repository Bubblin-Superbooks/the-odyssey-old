Nor aged Dolius; nor his sons, were there, Nor servants, absent on another care; To search the woods for sets of flowery thorn, Their orchard bounds to strengthen and adorn.</p><p>But all alone the hoary king he found; His habit course, but warmly wrapp'd around; His head, that bow'd with many a pensive care, Fenced with a double cap of goatskin hair: His buskins old, in former service torn, But swell repair'd; and gloves against the thorn. In this array the kingly gardener stood, And clear'd a plant, encumber'd with its wood.</p></div> </div>
