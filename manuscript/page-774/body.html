Nor gives the sun his golden orb to roll, But universal night usurps the pole!"</p><p>Yet warn'd in vain, with laughter loud elate The peers reproach the sure divine of Fate; And thus Eurymachus: "The dotard's mind To every sense is lost, to reason blind; Swift from the dome conduct the slave away; Let him in open air behold the day."</p><p>"Tax not (the heaven-illumined seer rejoin'd) Of rage, or folly, my prophetic mind, No clouds of error dim the ethereal rays, Her equal power each faithful sense obeys.</p></div> </div>
