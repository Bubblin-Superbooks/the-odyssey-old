'How shall I tread (I cried), ah, Circe! say, The dark descent, and who shall guide the way? Can living eyes behold the realms below? What bark to waft me, and what wind to blow?'</p><p>"'Thy fated road (the magic power replied), Divine Ulysses! ask no mortal guide. Rear but the mast, the spacious sail display, The northern winds shall wing thee on thy way.</p></div> </div>
