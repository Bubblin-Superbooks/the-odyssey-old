Turn then; oh peaceful turn, thy wrath control, And calm the raging tempest of thy soul.'</p><p>"While yet I speak, the shade disdains to stay, In silence turns, and sullen stalks away.</p><p>"Touch'd at his sour retreat, through deepest night, Through hell's black bounds I had pursued his flight, And forced the stubborn spectre to reply; But wondrous visions drew my curious eye. High on a throne, tremendous to behold, Stern Minos waves a mace of burnish'd gold; Around ten thousand thousand spectres stand Through the wide dome of Dis, a trembling band Still as they plead, the fatal lots he rolls, Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.</p></div> </div>
