<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Vanish'd are all the visionary joys; The soul of friendship to my hope is lost, Fated to wander from his natal coast!"</p><p>He ceased; a gush of grief began to rise: Fast streams a tide from beauteous Helen's eyes; Fast for the sire the filial sorrows flow; The weeping monarch swells the mighty woe; Thy cheeks, Pisistratus, the tears bedew, While pictured so thy mind appear'd in view, Thy martial brother; on the Phrygian plain Extended pale, by swarthy Memnon slain! But silence soon the son of Nestor broke, And melting with fraternal pity, spoke:</p><p>"Frequent, O king, was Nestor wont to raise And charm attention with thy copious praise; To crowd thy various gifts, the sage assign'd The glory of a firm capacious mind; With that superior attribute control This unavailing impotence of soul, Let not your roof with echoing grief resound, Now for the feast the friendly bowl is crown'd;</p></div> </div>
