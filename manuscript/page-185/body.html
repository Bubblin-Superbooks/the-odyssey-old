Which scarce the sea-fowl in a year o'erfly); Go then; to Sparta take the watery way, Thy ship and sailors but for orders stay; Or, if my land then choose thy course to bend, My steeds, my chariots, and my songs, attend; Thee to Atrides they shall safe convey, Guides of thy road, companions of thy way. Urge him with truth to frame his wise replies, And sure he will; for Menelaus is wise." Thus while he speaks the ruddy sun descends, And twilight grey her evening shade extends.</p></div> </div>
