<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Be it my task to send with ample stores The stranger from our hospitable shores: Tread you my steps! 'Tis mine to lead the race, The first in glory, as the first in place."</p><p>To whom the prince: "This night with joy I stay O monarch great in virtue as in sway! If thou the circling year my stay control, To raise a bounty noble as thy soul; The circling year I wait, with ampler stores And fitter pomp to hail my native shores: Then by my realms due homage would be paid; For wealthy kings are loyally obeyed!"</p><p>"O king! for such thou art, and sure thy blood Through veins (he cried) of royal fathers flow'd: Unlike those vagrants who on falsehood live, Skill'd in smooth tales, and artful to deceive; Thy better soul abhors the liar's part, Wise is thy voice, and noble is thy heart.</p></div> </div>
