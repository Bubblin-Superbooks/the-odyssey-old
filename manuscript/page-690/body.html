<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> An ivory seat with silver ringlets graced, By famed Icmalius wrought, the menials placed: With ivory silver'd thick the footstool shone, O'er which the panther's various hide was thrown. The sovereign seat with graceful air she press'd; To different tasks their toil the nymphs address'd: The golden goblets some, and some restored From stains of luxury the polish'd board: These to remove the expiring embers came, While those with unctuous fir foment the flame.</p><p>'Twas then Melantho with imperious mien Renew'd the attack, incontinent of spleen: "Avaunt (she cried), offensive to my sight! Deem not in ambush here to lurk by night, Into the woman-state asquint to pry; A day-devourer, and an evening spy! Vagrant, begone! before this blazing brand Shall urge"--and waved it hissing in her hand.</p></div> </div>
