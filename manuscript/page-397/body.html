<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As from some feast a man returning late, His faithful dogs all meet him at the gate, Rejoicing round, some morsel to receive, (Such as the good man ever used to give,) Domestic thus the grisly beasts drew near; They gaze with wonder not unmix'd with fear. Now on the threshold of the dome they stood, And heard a voice resounding through the wood: Placed at her loom within, the goddess sung; The vaulted roofs and solid pavement rung. O'er the fair web the rising figures shine, Immortal labour! worthy hands divine. Polites to the rest the question moved (A gallant leader, and a man I loved):</p><p>"'What voice celestial, chanting to the loom (Or nymph, or goddess), echoes from the room? Say, shall we seek access?' With that they call; And wide unfold the portals of the hall.</p></div> </div>
