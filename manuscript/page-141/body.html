<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Whether in fields by hostile fury slain, Or sunk by tempests in the gulfy main? Of this to learn, oppress'd with tender fears, Lo, at thy knee his suppliant son appears. If or thy certain eye, or curious ear, Have learnt his fate, the whole dark story clear And, oh! whate'er Heaven destined to betide, Let neither flattery soothe, nor pity hide. Prepared I stand: he was but born to try The lot of man; to suffer, and to die. Oh then, if ever through the ten years' war The wise, the good Ulysses claim'd thy care; If e'er he join'd thy council, or thy sword, True in his deed, and constant to his word; Far as thy mind through backward time can see Search all thy stores of faithful memory: 'Tis sacred truth I ask, and ask of thee."</p></div> </div>
