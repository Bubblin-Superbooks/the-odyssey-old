Can yet a doubt or any dread remain, When sworn that oath which never can be vain?'</p><p>"I answered: 'Goddess! human is my breast, By justice sway'd, by tender pity press'd: Ill fits it me, whose friends are sunk to beasts, To quaff thy bowls, or riot in thy feasts. Me would'st thou please? for them thy cares employ, And them to me restore, and me to joy.'</p><p>"With that she parted: in her potent hand She bore the virtue of the magic wand. Then, hastening to the sties, set wide the door, Urged forth, and drove the bristly herd before; Unwieldy, out they rush'd with general cry, Enormous beasts, dishonest to the eye.</p></div> </div>
