Suppliant he pray'd. And now the victims dress'd They draw, divide, and celebrate the feast. The banquet done, the narrative old man, Thus mild, the pleasing conference began:</p><p>"Now gentle guests! the genial banquet o'er, It fits to ask ye, what your native shore, And whence your race? on what adventure say, Thus far you wander through the watery way? Relate if business, or the thirst of gain, Engage your journey o'er the pathless main Where savage pirates seek through seas unknown The lives of others, venturous of their own."</p></div> </div>
