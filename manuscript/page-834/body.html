Soon fled the soul impure, and left behind The empty corse to waver with the wind.</p><p>Then forth they led Melanthius, and began Their bloody work; they lopp'd away the man, Morsel for dogs! then trimm'd with brazen shears The wretch, and shorten'd of his nose and ears; His hands and feet last felt the cruel steel: He roar'd, and torments gave his soul to hell. They wash, and to Ulysses take their way: So ends the bloody business of the day.</p></div> </div>
