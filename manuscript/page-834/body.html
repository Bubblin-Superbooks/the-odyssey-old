What cause compell'd so many, and so gay, To tread the downward, melancholy way? Say, could one city yield a troop so fair? Were all these partners of one native air? Or did the rage of stormy Neptune sweep Your lives at once, and whelm beneath the deep? Did nightly thieves, or pirates' cruel bands, Drench with your blood your pillaged country's sands? Or well-defending some beleaguer'd wall, Say,--for the public did ye greatly fall? Inform thy guest: for such I was of yore When our triumphant navies touch'd your shore; Forced a long month the wintry seas to bear, To move the great Ulysses to the war."</p><p>"O king of men! I faithful shall relate (Replied Amphimedon) our hapless fate.</p></div> </div>
