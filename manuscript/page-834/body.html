<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But whilst, to learn their lots in nuptial love, Bright Cytherea sought the bower of Jove (The God supreme, to whose eternal eye The registers of fate expanded lie; Wing'd Harpies snatch the unguarded charge away, And to the Furies bore a grateful prey. Be such my lot! Or thou, Diana, speed Thy shaft, and send me joyful to the dead; To seek my lord among the warrior train, Ere second vows my bridal faith profane. When woes the waking sense alone assail, Whilst Night extends her soft oblivious veil, Of other wretches' care the torture ends; No truce the warfare of my heart suspends! The night renews the day distracting theme, And airy terrors sable every dream.</p></div> </div>
