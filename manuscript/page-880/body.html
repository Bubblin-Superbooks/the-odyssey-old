While some deriding--"How he turns the bow! Some other like it sure the man must know, Or else would copy; or in bows he deals; Perhaps he makes them, or perhaps he steals."

With such good fortune as he now shall find."</p><p>Heedless he heard them: but disdain'd reply; The bow perusing with exactest eye.</p></div> </div>
