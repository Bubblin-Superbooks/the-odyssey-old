<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Sudden I stir the embers, and inspire With animating breath the seeds of fire: Each drooping spirit with bold words repair, And urged my train the dreadful deed to dare. The stake now glow'd beneath the burning bed (Green as it was) and sparkled fiery red, Then forth the vengeful instrument I bring; With beating hearts my fellows form a ring. Urged my some present god, they swift let fall The pointed torment on his visual ball. Myself above them from a rising ground Guide the sharp stake, and twirl it round and round.</p></div> </div>
