With equal fury, and with equal fame, Ulysses soon shall reassert his claim. O Jove supreme, whom gods and men revere! And thou! to whom 'tis given to gild the sphere! With power congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid! Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when contending on the Lesbian shore His prowess Philomelidies confess'd, And loud-acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd; Then soon the invaders of his bed and throne Their love presumptuous shall with life atone. With patient ear, O royal youth, attend The storied labour of thy father's friend: Fruitful of deeds, the copious tale is long, But truth severe shall dictate to my tongue: Learn what I heard the sea-born seer relate, Whose eye can pierce the dark recess of fate.</p></div> </div>
