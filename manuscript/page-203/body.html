For this the gods each favouring gale restrain Jealous, to see their high behests obey'd; Severe, if men the eternal rights evade. High o'er a gulfy sea, the Pharian isle Fronts the deep roar of disemboguing Nile: Her distance from the shore, the course begun At dawn, and ending with the setting sun, A galley measures; when the stiffer gales Rise on the poop, and fully stretch the sails. There, anchor'd vessels safe in harbour lie, Whilst limpid springs the failing cask supply.</p><p>"And now the twentieth sun, descending, laves His glowing axle in the western waves: Still with expanded sails we court in vain Propitious winds to waft us o'er the main; And the pale mariner at once deplores His drooping vigour and exhausted stores.</p></div> </div>
