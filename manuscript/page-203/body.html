Sufficed, soft whispering thus to Nestor's son, His head reclined, young Ithacus begun:</p><p>"View'st thou unmoved, O ever-honour'd most! These prodigies of art, and wondrous cost! Above, beneath, around the palace shines The sunless treasure of exhausted mines; The spoils of elephants the roofs inlay, And studded amber darts the golden ray; Such, and not nobler, in the realms above My wonder dictates is the dome of Jove."</p></div> </div>
