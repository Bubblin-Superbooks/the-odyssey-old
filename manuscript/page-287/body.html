<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With skill the virgin guides the embroider'd rein, Slow rolls the car before the attending train, Now whirling down the heavens, the golden day Shot through the western clouds a dewy ray; The grove they reach, where, from the sacred shade, To Pallas thus the pensive hero pray'd:</p><p>"Daughter of Jove! whose arms in thunder wield The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield; Forsook by thee, in vain I sought thy aid When booming billows closed above my bead; Attend, unconquer'd maid! accord my vows, Bid the Great hear, and pitying, heal my woes."</p><p>This heard Minerva, but forbore to fly (By Neptune awed) apparent from the sky; Stern god! who raged with vengeance, unrestrain'd. Till great Ulysses hail'd his native land.</p></div> </div>
