The godlike leaders who, in battle slain, Fell before Troy, and nobly press'd the plain? And lo! a length of night behind remains, The evening stars still mount the ethereal plains. Thy tale with raptures I could hear thee tell, Thy woes on earth, the wondrous scenes in hell, Till in the vault of heaven the stars decay. And the sky reddens with the rising day."</p><p>"O worthy of the power the gods assign'd (Ulysses thus replies), a king in mind: Since yet the early hour of night allows Time for discourse, and time for soft repose, If scenes of misery can entertain, Woes I unfold, of woes a dismal train. Prepare to heir of murder and of blood; Of godlike heroes who uninjured stood Amidst a war of spears in foreign lands, Yet bled at home, and bled by female hands.</p></div> </div>
