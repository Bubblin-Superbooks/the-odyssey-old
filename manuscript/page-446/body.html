The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn, But mourn in vain; no prospect of return Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer, The next proud Lamos' stately towers appear, And Laestrygonia's gates arise distinct in air. The shepherd, quitting here at night the plain, Calls, to succeed his cares, the watchful swain; But he that scorns the chains of sleep to wear, And adds the herdsman's to the shepherd's care, So near the pastures, and so short the way, His double toils may claim a double pay, And join the labours of the night and day.</p></div> </div>
