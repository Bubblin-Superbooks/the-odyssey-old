That instant from the skies The martial goddess to Ulysses flies: She waves her golden wand, and reassumes From every feature every grace that blooms; At once his vestures change; at once she sheds Age o'er his limbs, that tremble as he treads: Lest to the queen the swain with transport fly, Unable to contain the unruly joy; When near he drew, the prince breaks forth: "Proclaim What tidings, friend? what speaks the voice of fame? Say, if the suitors measure back the main, Or still in ambush thirst for blood in vain?"</p><p>"Whether (he cries) they measure back the flood, Or still in ambush thirst in vain for blood, Escaped my care: where lawless suitors sway, Thy mandate borne my soul disdain'd to stay.</p></div> </div>
