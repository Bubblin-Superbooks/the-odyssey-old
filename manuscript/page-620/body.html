<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Each neighbouring realm, conducive to our woe, Sends forth her peers, and every peer a foe: The court proud Samos and Dulichium fills, And lofty Zacinth crown'd with shady hills. E'en Ithaca and all her lords invade The imperial sceptre, and the regal bed: The queen, averse to love, yet awed by power, Seems half to yield, yet flies the bridal hour: Meantime their licence uncontroll'd I bear; E'en now they envy me the vital air: But Heaven will sure revenge, and gods there are.</p><p>"But go Eumaeus! to the queen impart Our safe return, and ease a mother's heart. Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes, And here at least I may in peace repose."</p></div> </div>
