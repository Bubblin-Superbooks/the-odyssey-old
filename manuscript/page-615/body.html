<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Hast thou forgot, ungrateful as thou art, Who saved thy father with a friendly part? Lawless he ravaged with his martial powers The Taphian pirates on Thesprotia's shores; Enraged, his life, his treasures they demand; Ulysses saved him from the avenger's hand. And would'st thou evil for his good repay? His bed dishonour, and his house betray? Afflict his queen, and with a murderous hand Destroy his heir!--but cease, 'tis I command."</p><p>"Far hence those fears (Eurymachus replied,) O prudent princess! bid thy soul confide. Breathes there a man who dares that hero slay, While I behold the golden light of day? No: by the righteous powers of heaven I swear, His blood in vengeance smokes upon my spear. Ulysses, when my infant days I led, With wine sufficed me, and with dainties fed: My generous soul abhors the ungrateful part, And my friend's son lives nearest to my heart. Then fear no mortal arm; if Heaven destroy, We must resign: for man is born to die."</p></div> </div>
