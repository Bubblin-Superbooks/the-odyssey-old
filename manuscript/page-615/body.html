<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> the powers celestial give To shun the hidden snares of death, and live. But die he shall, and thus condemn'd to bleed, Be now the scene of instant death decreed. Hope ye success? undaunted crush the foe. Is he not wise? know this, and strike the blow. Wait ye, till he to arms in council draws The Greeks, averse too justly to our cause? Strike, ere, the states convened, the foe betray Our murderous ambush on the watery way. Or choose ye vagrant from their rage to fly, Outcasts of earth, to breathe an unknown sky? The brave prevent misfortune; then be brave, And bury future danger in his grave. Returns he? ambush'd we'll his walk invade, Or where he hides in solitude and shade; And give the palace to the queen a dower, Or him she blesses in the bridal hour. But if submissive you resign the sway, Slaves to a boy, go, flatter and obey.</p></div> </div>
