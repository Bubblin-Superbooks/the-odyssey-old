With imprecations thus he fill'd the air, And angry Neptune heard the unrighteous prayer, A larger rock then heaving from the plain, He whirl'd it round: it sung across the main; It fell, and brush'd the stern: the billows roar, Shake at the weight, and refluent beat the shore. With all our force we kept aloof to sea, And gain'd the island where our vessels lay. Our sight the whole collected navy cheer'd. Who, waiting long, by turns had hoped and fear'd.</p></div> </div>
