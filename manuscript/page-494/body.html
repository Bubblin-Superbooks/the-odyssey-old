<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Firm at the helm I stand, when fierce the main Rush'd with dire noise, and dash'd the sides in twain; Again impetuous drove the furious blast, Snapp'd the strong helm, and bore to sea the mast. Firm to the mast with cords the helm I bind, And ride aloft, to Providence resign'd, Through tumbling billows and a war of wind. "Now sunk the west, and now a southern breeze, More dreadful than the tempest lash'd the seas; For on the rocks it bore where Scylla raves, And dire Charybdis rolls her thundering waves. All night I drove; and at the dawn of day, Fast by the rocks beheld the desperate way; Just when the sea within her gulfs subsides, And in the roaring whirlpools rush the tides, Swift from the float I vaulted with a bound, The lofty fig-tree seized, and clung around; So to the beam the bat tenacious clings, And pendent round it clasps his leather wings.</p></div> </div>
