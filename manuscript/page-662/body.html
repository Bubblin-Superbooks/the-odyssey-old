<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Rise, try the fight, Gird well thy loins, approach, and feel my might: Sure of defeat, before the peers engage: Unequal fight, when youth contends with age!"</p><p>Thus in a wordy war their tongues display More fierce intents, preluding to the fray; Antinous hears, and in a jovial vein, Thus with loud laughter to the suitor train:</p><p>"This happy day in mirth, my friends, employ, And lo! the gods conspire to crown our joy; See ready for the fight, and hand to hand, Yon surly mendicants contentious stand: Why urge we not to blows!" Well pleased they spring Swift from their seats, and thickening form a ring.</p><p>To whom Antinous: "Lo! enrich'd with blood, A kid's well-fatted entrails (tasteful food) On glowing embers lie; on him bestow The choicest portion who subdues his foe; Grant him unrivall'd in these walls to stay, The sole attendant on the genial day."</p></div> </div>
