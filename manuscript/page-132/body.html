<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> While to the rival train the prince returns, The martial goddess with impatience burns; Like thee, Telemachus, in voice and size, With speed divine from street to street she flies, She bids the mariners prepared to stand, When night descends, embodied on the strand. Then to Noemon swift she runs, she flies, And asks a bark: the chief a bark supplies.</p><p>And now, declining with his sloping wheels, Down sunk the sun behind the western hills The goddess shoved the vessel from the shores, And stow'd within its womb the naval stores, Full in the openings of the spacious main It rides; and now descends the sailor-train,</p><p>Next, to the court, impatient of delay. With rapid step the goddess urged her way; There every eye with slumberous chains she bound, And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground. Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress'd, Reel'd from the palace, and retired to rest.</p></div> </div>
