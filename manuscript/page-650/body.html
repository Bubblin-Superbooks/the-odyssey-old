<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The golden ewer a nymph attendant brings, Replenish'd from the pure translucent springs; With copious streams that golden ewer supplies A silver layer of capacious size. They wash: the table, in fair order spread, Is piled with viands and the strength of bread. Full opposite, before the folding gate, The pensive mother sits in humble state; Lowly she sate, and with dejected view The fleecy threads her ivory fingers drew. The prince and stranger shared the genial feast, Till now the rage of thirst and hunger ceased.</p><p>When thus the queen: "My son! my only friend! Say, to my mournful couch shall I ascend? (The couch deserted now a length of years; The couch for ever water'd with my tears;) Say, wilt thou not (ere yet the suitor crew Return, and riot shakes our walls anew), Say, wilt thou not the least account afford? The least glad tidings of my absent lord?"</p></div> </div>
