<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A bowl that flames with gold, of wondrous frame, Ourself we give, memorial of our name; To raise in offerings to almighty Jove, And every god that treads the courts above."</p><p>Instant the queen, observant of the king, Commands her train a spacious vase to bring, The spacious vase with ample streams suffice, Heap the high wood, and bid the flames arise. The flames climb round it with a fierce embrace, The fuming waters bubble o'er the blaze. Herself the chest prepares; in order roll'd The robes, the vests are ranged, and heaps of gold And adding a rich dress inwrought with art, A gift expressive of her bounteous heart. Thus spoke to Ithacus: "To guard with bands Insolvable these gifts, thy care demands; Lest, in thy slumbers on the watery main, The hand of rapine make our bounty vain."</p></div> </div>
