<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As o'er the heaps of death Ulysses strode, These eyes, these eyes beheld a present god, Who now before him, now beside him stood, Fought as he fought, and mark'd his way with blood: In vain old Mentor's form the god belied; 'Twas Heaven that struck, and Heaven was on his side."</p><p>A sudden horror all the assembly shook, When slowly rising, Halitherses spoke (Reverend and wise, whose comprehensive view At once the present and the future knew): "Me too, ye fathers, hear! from you proceed The ills ye mourn; your own the guilty deed. Ye gave your sons, your lawless sons, the rein (Oft warn'd by Mentor and myself in vain); An absent hero's bed they sought to soil, An absent hero's wealth they made their spoil; Immoderate riot, and intemperate lust! The offence was great, the punishment was just. Weigh then my counsels in an equal scale, Nor rush to ruin. Justice will prevail."</p></div> </div>
