Your fellows live; believe your eyes, and come To taste the joys of Circe's sacred dome.'</p><p>"With ready speed the joyful crew obey: Alone Eurylochus persuades their stay.</p><p>"'Whither (he cried), ah whither will ye run? Seek ye to meet those evils ye should shun? Will you the terrors of the dome explore, In swine to grovel, or in lions roar, Or wolf-like howl away the midnight hour In dreadful watch around the magic bower? Remember Cyclops, and his bloody deed; The leader's rashness made the soldiers bleed.'</p></div> </div>
