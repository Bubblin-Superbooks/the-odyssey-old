<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Grateful vicissitudes! yet me withdrawn, Wakeful to weep and watch the tardy dawn Establish'd use enjoins; to rest and joy Estranged, since dear Ulysses sail'd to Troy! Meantime instructed is the menial tribe Your couch to fashion as yourself prescribe."</p><p>Thus affable, her bower the queen ascends; The sovereign step a beauteous train attends; There imaged to her soul Ulysses rose; Down her pale cheek new-streaming sorrow flows; Till soft oblivious shade Minerva spread, And o'er her eyes ambrosial slumber shed.</p></div> </div>
