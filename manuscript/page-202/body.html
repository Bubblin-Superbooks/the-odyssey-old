<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When o'er the eastern lawn, In saffron robes, the daughter of the dawn Advanced her rosy steps, before the bay Due ritual honours to the gods I pay; Then seek the place the sea-born nymph assign'd, With three associates of undaunted mind. Arrived, to form along the appointed strand For each a bed, she scoops the hilly sand; Then, from her azure cave the finny spoils Of four vast Phocae takes, to veil her wiles; Beneath the finny spoils extended prone, Hard toil! the prophet's piercing eye to shun; New from the corse, the scaly frauds diffuse Unsavoury stench of oil, and brackish ooze; But the bright sea-maid's gentle power implored, With nectar'd drops the sickening sense restored.</p><p>"Thus till the sun had travell'd half the skies, Ambush'd we lie, and wait the bold emprise;</p></div> </div>
