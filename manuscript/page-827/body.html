Beside the gate the reverend minstrel stands; The lyre now silent trembling in his hands; Dubious to supplicate the chief, or fly To Jove's inviolable altar nigh, Where oft Laertes holy vows had paid, And oft Ulysses smoking victims laid. His honour'd harp with care he first set down, Between the laver and the silver throne; Then prostrate stretch'd before the dreadful man, Persuasive thus, with accent soft began:</p><p>"O king! to mercy be thy soul inclined, And spare the poet's ever-gentle kind. A deed like this thy future fame would wrong, For dear to gods and men is sacred song.</p></div> </div>
