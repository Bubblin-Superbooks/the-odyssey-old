<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"As from fresh pastures and the dewy field (When loaded cribs their evening banquet yield) The lowing herds return; around them throng With leaps and bounds their late imprison'd young, Rush to their mothers with unruly joy, And echoing hills return the tender cry: So round me press'd, exulting at my sight, With cries and agonies of wild delight, The weeping sailors; nor less fierce their joy Than if return'd to Ithaca from Troy. 'Ah master! ever honour'd, ever dear! (These tender words on every side I hear) What other joy can equal thy return? Not that loved country for whose sight we mourn, The soil that nursed us, and that gave us breath: But ah! relate our lost companions' death.'</p></div> </div>
