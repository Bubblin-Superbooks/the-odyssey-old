Swift at the royal nod the attending train The car prepare, the mules incessant rein, The blooming virgin with despatchful cares Tunics, and stoles, and robes imperial, bears. The queen, assiduous to her train assigns The sumptuous viands, and the flavorous wines. The train prepare a cruse of curious mould, A cruse of fragrance, form'd of burnish'd gold; Odour divine! whose soft refreshing streams Sleek the smooth skin, and scent the snowy limbs.</p><p>Now mounting the gay seat, the silken reins Shine in her hand; along the sounding plains Swift fly the mules; nor rode the nymph alone; Around, a bevy of bright damsels shone. They seek the cisterns where Phaeacian dames Wash their fair garments in the limpid streams; Where, gathering into depth from falling rills, The lucid wave a spacious bason fills. The mules, unharness'd, range beside the main, Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.</p></div> </div>
