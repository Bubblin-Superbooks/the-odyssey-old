<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The thighs now sacrificed, and entrails dress'd, The assistants part, transfix, and broil the rest While these officious tend the rites divine, The last fair branch of the Nestorean line, Sweet Polycaste, took the pleasing toil To bathe the prince, and pour the fragrant oil. O'er his fair limbs a flowery vest he throw, And issued, like a god, to mortal view. His former seat beside the king he found (His people's father with his peers around); All placed at ease the holy banquet join, And in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine.</p><p>The rage of thirst and hunger now suppress'd, The monarch turns him to his royal guest; And for the promised journey bids prepare The smooth hair'd horses, and the rapid car. Observant of his word, tire word scarce spoke, The sons obey, and join them to the yoke.</p></div> </div>
