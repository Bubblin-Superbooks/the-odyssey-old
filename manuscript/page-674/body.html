<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Well-pleased Ulysses hears his queen deceive The suitor-train, and raise a thirst to give: False hopes she kindles, but those hopes betray, And promise, yet elude, the bridal day.</p><p>While yet she speaks, the gay Antinous cries: "Offspring of kings, and more than woman wise! 'Tis right; 'tis man's prerogative to give, And custom bids thee without shame receive; Yet never, never, from thy dome we move, Till Hymen lights the torch of spousal love."</p><p>The peers despatch'd their heralds to convey The gifts of love; with speed they take the way. A robe Antinous gives of shining dyes, The varying hues in gay confusion rise Rich from the artist's hand! Twelve clasps of gold Close to the lessening waist the vest infold! Down from the swelling loins the vest unbound Floats in bright waves redundant o'er the ground, A bracelet rich with gold, with amber gay, That shot effulgence like the solar ray, Eurymachus presents: and ear-rings bright, With triple stars, that casts a trembling light.</p></div> </div>
