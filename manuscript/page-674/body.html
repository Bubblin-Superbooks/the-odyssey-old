Oh would to Jove! or her whose arms display The shield of Jove, or him who rules the day! That yon proud suitors, who licentious tread These courts, within these courts like Irus bled: Whose loose head tottering, as with wine oppress'd, Obliquely drops, and nodding knocks his breast; Powerless to move, his staggering feet deny The coward wretch the privilege to fly."</p></div> </div>
