<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The seneschal, rebuked, in haste withdrew; With equal haste a menial train pursue: Part led the coursers, from the car enlarged, Each to a crib with choicest grain surcharged; Part in a portico, profusely graced With rich magnificence, the chariot placed; Then to the dome the friendly pair invite, Who eye the dazzling roofs with vast delight; Resplendent as the blaze of summer noon, Or the pale radiance of the midnight moon. From room to room their eager view they bend Thence to the bath, a beauteous pile, descend; Where a bright damsel train attends the guests With liquid odours, and embroider'd vests. Refresh'd, they wait them to the bower of state, Where, circled with his pears, Atrides sate; Throned next the king, a fair attendant brings The purest product of the crystal springs;</p></div> </div>
