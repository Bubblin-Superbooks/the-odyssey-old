<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such fate I prophesy our guest attends, If here this interdicted bow he bends: Nor shall these walls such insolence contain: The first fair wind transports him o'er the main, Where Echetus to death the guilty brings (The worst of mortals, e'en the worst of kings). Better than that, if thou approve our cheer; Cease the mad strife and share our bounty here."</p><p>To this the queen her just dislike express'd:</p><p>"'Tis impious, prince, to harm the stranger-guest, Base to insult who bears a suppliant's name, And some respect Telemachus may claim. What if the immortals on the man bestow Sufficient strength to draw the mighty bow? Shall I, a queen, by rival chiefs adored, Accept a wandering stranger for my lord? A hope so idle never touch'd his brain: Then ease your bosoms of a fear so vain. Far be he banish'd from this stately scene Who wrongs his princess with a thought so mean."</p></div> </div>
