<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Stranger, may fate a milder aspect show, And spin thy future with a whiter clue! O Jove! for ever death to human cries; The tyrant, not the father of the skies! Unpiteous of the race thy will began! The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man, With penury, contempt, repulse, and care, The galling load of life is doom'd to bear. Ulysses from his state a wanderer still, Upbraids thy power, thy wisdom, or thy will! O monarch ever dear!-O man of woe! Fresh flow my tears, and shall for ever flow! Like thee, poor stranger guest, denied his home, Like thee: in rags obscene decreed to roam! Or, haply perish'd on some distant coast, In stygian gloom he glides, a pensive ghost! Oh, grateful for the good his bounty gave, I'll grieve, till sorrow sink me to the grave! His kind protecting hand my youth preferr'd, The regent of his Cephalenian herd;</p></div> </div>
