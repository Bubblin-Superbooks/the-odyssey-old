Our freedom to thy prowess'd arm we owe From bold intrusion of thy coward foe: Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing To Eschetus, the monster of a king."</p><p>While pleased he hears, Antinous bears the food, A kid's well-fatted entrails, rich with blood; The bread from canisters of shining mould Amphinomus; and wines that laugh in gold: "And oh! (he mildly cries) may Heaven display A beam of glory o'er thy future day! Alas, the brave too oft is doom'd to bear The gripes of poverty and stings of care."</p></div> </div>
