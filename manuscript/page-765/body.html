Constrain'd, the choicest beeves I thence import, To cram these cormorants that crowd his court: Who in partition seek his realm to share; Nor human right nor wrath divine revere, Since here resolved oppressive these reside, Contending doubts my anxious heart divide: Now to some foreign clime inclined to fly, And with the royal herd protection buy; Then, happier thoughts return the nodding scale, Light mounts despair, alternate hopes prevail: In opening prospects of ideal joy, My king returns; the proud usurpers die."</p><p>To whom the chief: "In thy capacious mind Since daring zeal with cool debate is join'd, Attend a deed already ripe in fate: Attest, O Jove! the truth I now relate! This sacred truth attest, each genial power, Who bless the board, and guard this friendly bower!</p></div> </div>
