Tumultuous waves embroil the bellowing flood, All trembling, deafen'd, and aghast we stood! No more the vessel plough'd the dreadful wave, Fear seized the mighty, and unnerved the brave; Each dropp'd his oar; but swift from man to man With looks serene I turn'd, and thus began: 'O friends! O often tried in adverse storms! With ills familiar in more dreadful forms! Deep in the dire Cyclopean den you lay, Yet safe return'd--Ulysses led the way. Learn courage hence, and in my care confide; Lo! still the same Ulysses is your guide. Attend my words! your oars incessant ply; Strain every nerve, and bid the vessel fly.</p></div> </div>
