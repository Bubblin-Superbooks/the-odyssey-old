Well pleased they spring Swift from their seats, and thickening form a ring.</p><p>To whom Antinous: "Lo! enrich'd with blood, A kid's well-fatted entrails (tasteful food) On glowing embers lie; on him bestow The choicest portion who subdues his foe; Grant him unrivall'd in these walls to stay, The sole attendant on the genial day."</p><p>The lords applaud: Ulysses then with art, And fears well-feign'd, disguised his dauntless heart.</p></div> </div>
