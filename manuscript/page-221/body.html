<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> These rites to piety and grief discharged, The friendly gods a springing gale enlarged; The fleet swift tilting o'er the surges flew, Till Grecian cliffs appear'd a blissful view!</p><p>"Thy patient ear hath heard me long relate A story, fruitful of disastrous fate. And now, young prince, indulge my fond request; Be Sparta honoured with his royal guest, Till, from his eastern goal, the joyous sun His twelfth diurnal race begins to run. Meantime my train the friendly gifts prepare, The sprightly coursers and a polish'd car; With these a goblet of capacious mould, Figured with art to dignify the gold (Form'd for libation to the gods), shall prove A pledge and monument of sacred love."</p></div> </div>
