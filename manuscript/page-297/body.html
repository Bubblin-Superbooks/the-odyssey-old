<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Here order'd vines in equal ranks appear, With all the united labours of the year; Some to unload the fertile branches run, Some dry the blackening clusters in the sun, Others to tread the liquid harvest join: The groaning presses foam with floods of wine Here are the vines in early flower descried, Here grapes discolour'd on the sunnyside, And there in autumn's richest purple dyed,</p><p>Beds of all various herbs, for ever green, In beauteous order terminate the scene.</p><p>Two plenteous fountains the whole prospect crown'd This through the gardens leads its streams around Visits each plant, and waters all the ground; While that in pipes beneath the palace flows, And thence its current on the town bestows: To various use their various streams they bring, The people one, and one supplies the king.</p></div> </div>
