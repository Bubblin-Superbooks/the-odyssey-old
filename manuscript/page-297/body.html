<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The third fair morn now blazed upon the main; Then glassy smooth lay all the liquid plain; The winds were hush'd, the billows scarcely curl'd, And a dead silence still'd the watery world; When lifted on a ridgy wave he spies The land at distance, and with sharpen'd eyes. As pious children joy with vast delight When a loved sire revives before their sight (Who, lingering along, has call'd on death in vain, Fix'd by some demon to his bed of pain, Till heaven by miracle his life restore); So joys Ulysses at the appearing shore; And sees (and labours onward as he sees) The rising forests, and the tufted trees.</p></div> </div>
