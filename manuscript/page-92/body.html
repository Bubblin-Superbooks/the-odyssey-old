But ah, I dream!-the appointed hour is fled. And hope, too long with vain delusion fed, Deaf to the rumour of fallacious fame, Gives to the roll of death his glorious name!

Now first to me this visit dost thou deign, Or number'd in my father's social train? All who deserved his choice he made his own, And, curious much to know, he far was known."</p><p>"My birth I boast (the blue-eyed virgin cries) From great Anchialus, renown'd and wise; Mentes my name;</p></div> </div>
