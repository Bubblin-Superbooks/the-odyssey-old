<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Now snatch'd by harpies to the dreary coast. Sunk is the hero, and his glory lost; Vanish'd at once! unheard of, and unknown! And I his heir in misery alone. Nor for a dear lost father only flow The filial tears, but woe succeeds to woe To tempt the spouseless queen with amorous wiles Resort the nobles from the neighbouring isles; From Samos, circled with the Ionian main, Dulichium, and Zacynthas' sylvan reign; Ev'n with presumptuous hope her bed to ascend, The lords of Ithaca their right pretend. She seems attentive to their pleaded vows, Her heart detesting what her ear allows. They, vain expectants of the bridal hour, My stores in riotous expense devour. In feast and dance the mirthful months employ, And meditate my doom to crown their joy."</p><p>With tender pity touch'd, the goddess cried: "Soon may kind Heaven a sure relief provide, Soon may your sire discharge</p></div> </div>
