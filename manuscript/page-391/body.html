<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Swift at her call her husband scour'd away To wreak his hunger on the destined prey; One for his food the raging glutton slew, But two rush'd out, and to the navy flew.</p><p>"Balk'd of his prey, the yelling monster flies, And fills the city with his hideous cries; A ghastly band of giants hear the roar, And, pouring down the mountains, crowd the shore. Fragments they rend from off the craggy brow And dash the ruins on the ships below; The crackling vessels burst; hoarse groans arise, And mingled horrors echo to the skies; The men like fish, they struck upon the flood, And cramm'd their filthy throats with human food. Whilst thus their fury rages at the bay, My sword our cables cut, I call'd to weigh; And charged my men, as they from fate would fly, Each nerve to strain, each bending oar to ply.</p></div> </div>
