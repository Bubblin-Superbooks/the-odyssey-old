It almost brush'd the helm, and fell before: The whole sea shook, and refluent beat the shore, The strong concussion on the heaving tide Roll'd back the vessel to the island's side: Again I shoved her off: our fate to fly, Each nerve we stretch, and every oar we ply. Just 'scaped impending death, when now again We twice as far had furrow'd back the main, Once more I raise my voice; my friends, afraid, With mild entreaties my design dissuade: 'What boots the godless giant to provoke, Whose arm may sink us at a single stroke? Already when the dreadful rock he threw, Old Ocean shook, and back his surges flew. The sounding voice directs his aim again; The rock o'erwhelms us, and we 'scaped in vain.'</p></div> </div>
