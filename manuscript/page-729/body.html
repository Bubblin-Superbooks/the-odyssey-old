<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Without retinue, to that friendly shore Welcomed with gifts of price, a sumless store! His sacrilegious train, who dared to prey On herds devoted to the god of day, Were doom'd by Jove, and Phoebus' just decree, To perish in the rough Trinacrian sea. To better fate the blameless chief ordain'd, A floating fragment of the wreck regain'd, And rode the storm; till, by the billows toss'd, He landed on the fair Phaeacian coast. That race who emulate the life of gods, Receive him joyous to their bless'd abodes; Large gifts confer, a ready sail command, To speed his voyage to the Grecian strand. But your wise lord (in whose capacious soul High schemes of power in just succession roll) His Ithaca refused from favouring Fate, Till copious wealth might guard his regal state.</p></div> </div>
