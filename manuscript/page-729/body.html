<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Neritus, Ithacus, Polyctor, there, In sculptured stone immortalized their care, In marble urns received it from above, And shaded with a green surrounding grove; Where silver alders, in high arches twined, Drink the cool stream, and tremble to the wind. Beneath, sequester'd to the nymphs, is seen A mossy altar, deep embower'd in green; Where constant vows by travellers are paid, And holy horrors solemnize the shade.</p><p>Here with his goats (not vow'd to sacred fame, But pamper'd luxury) Melanthias came: Two grooms attend him. With an envious look He eyed the stranger, and imperious spoke:</p><p>"The good old proverb how this pair fulfil! One rogue is usher to another still. Heaven with a secret principle endued Mankind, to seek their own similitude.</p></div> </div>
