<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some voice of God close whispering from within, 'Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.' But these, no doubt, some oracle explore, That tells, the great Ulysses is no more. Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise: Constant as Jove the night and day bestows, Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows. None match'd this hero's wealth, of all who reign O'er the fair islands of the neighbouring main. Nor all the monarchs whose far-dreaded sway The wide-extended continents obey: First, on the main land, of Ulysses' breed Twelve herds, twelve flocks, on ocean's margin feed; As many stalls for shaggy goats are rear'd; As many lodgments for the tusky herd; Two foreign keepers guard: and here are seen Twelve herds of goats that graze our utmost green; To native pastors is their charge assign'd, And mine the care to feed the bristly kind;</p></div> </div>
