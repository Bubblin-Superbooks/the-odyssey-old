<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Abash'd, the numbers hear the godlike man, Till great Alcinous mildly thus began:</p><p>"Well hast thou spoke, and well thy generous tongue With decent pride refutes a public wrong: Warm are thy words, but warm without offence; Fear only fools, secure in men of sense; Thy worth is known. Then hear our country's claim, And bear to heroes our heroic fame: In distant realms our glorious deeds display, Repeat them frequent in the genial day; When, blest with ease, thy woes and wanderings end, Teach them thy consort, bid thy sons attend; How, loved of Jove, he crown'd our sires with praise, How we their offspring dignify our race.</p><p>"Let other realms the deathful gauntlet wield, Or boast the glories of the athletic field: We in the course unrivall'd speed display, Or through cerulean billows plough the way;</p></div> </div>
