Some joy remains: to thee a son is given, Such as, in fondness, parents ask of Heaven."</p><p>"Ah me! forbear!" returns the queen, "forbear, Oh! talk not, talk not of vain beauty's care; No more I bathe, since he no longer sees Those charms, for whom alone I wish to please. The day that bore Ulysses from this coast Blasted the little bloom these cheeks could boast. But instant bid Autonoe descend, Instant Hippodame our steps attend; Ill suits it female virtue, to be seen Alone, indecent, in the walks of men."</p></div> </div>
