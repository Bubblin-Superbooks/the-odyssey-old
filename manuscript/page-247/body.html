<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> So when Aurora sought Orion's love, Her joys disturbed your blissful hours above, Till, in Ortygia Dian's winged dart Had pierced the hapless hunter to the heart, So when the covert of the thrice-eared field Saw stately Ceres to her passion yield, Scarce could Iasion taste her heavenly charms, But Jove's swift lightning scorched him in her arms. And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers! Am I the envy of your blissful bowers? A man, an outcast to the storm and wave, It was my crime to pity, and to save; When he who thunders rent his bark in twain, And sunk his brave companions in the main, Alone, abandon'd, in mid-ocean tossed, The sport of winds, and driven from every coast, Hither this man of miseries I led, Received the friendless, and the hungry fed; Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe.</p></div> </div>
