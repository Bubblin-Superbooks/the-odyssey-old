Is then reversed the sentence of the sky, In one man's favour; while a distant guest I shared secure the AEthiopian feast? Behold how near Phoenecia's land he draws; The land affix'd by Fate's eternal laws To end his toils. Is then our anger vain? No; if this sceptre yet commands the main."</p><p>He spoke, and high the forky trident hurl'd, Rolls clouds on clouds, and stirs the watery world, At once the face of earth and sea deforms, Swells all the winds, and rouses all the storms.</p></div> </div>
