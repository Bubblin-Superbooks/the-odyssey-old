<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"If from the skies a goddess, or if earth (Imperial virgin) boast thy glorious birth, To thee I bend! If in that bright disguise Thou visit earth, a daughter of the skies, Hail, Dian, hail! the huntress of the groves So shines majestic, and so stately moves, So breathes an air divine! But if thy race Be mortal, and this earth thy native place, Blest is the father from whose loins you sprung, Blest is the mother at whose breast you hung. Blest are the brethren who thy blood divide, To such a miracle of charms allied: Joyful they see applauding princes gaze, When stately in the dance you swim the harmonious maze. But blest o'er all, the youth with heavenly charms, Who clasps the bright perfection in his arms! Never, I never view'd till this blast hour Such finish'd grace! I gaze, and I adore! Thus seems the palm with stately honours crown'd By Phoebus' altars; thus o'erlooks the ground; The pride of Delos.</p></div> </div>
