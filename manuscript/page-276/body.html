Know, the Phaecian tribes this land divide; From great Alcinous' royal loins I spring, A happy nation, and a happy king."</p><p>Then to her maids: "Why, why, ye coward train, These fears, this flight? ye fear, and fly in vain. Dread ye a foe? dismiss that idle dread, 'Tis death with hostile step these shores to tread; Safe in the love of heaven, an ocean flows Around our realm, a barrier from the foes; 'Tis ours this son of sorrow to relieve, Cheer the sad heart, nor let affliction grieve. By Jove the stranger and the poor are sent; And what to those we give to Jove is lent. Then food supply, and bathe his fainting limbs Where waving shades obscure the mazy streams."</p></div> </div>
