<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And is it now my turn, ye mighty powers! Am I the envy of your blissful bowers? A man, an outcast to the storm and wave, It was my crime to pity, and to save; When he who thunders rent his bark in twain, And sunk his brave companions in the main, Alone, abandon'd, in mid-ocean tossed, The sport of winds, and driven from every coast, Hither this man of miseries I led, Received the friendless, and the hungry fed; Nay promised (vainly promised) to bestow Immortal life, exempt from age and woe. 'Tis past-and Jove decrees he shall remove; Gods as we are, we are but slaves to Jove. Go then he must (he must, if he ordain, Try all those dangers, all those deeps, again); But never, never shall Calypso send To toils like these her husband and her friend.</p></div> </div>
