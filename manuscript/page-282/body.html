<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>' And just the blame: for female innocence Not only flies the guilt, but shuns the offence: The unguarded virgin, as unchaste, I blame; And the least freedom with the sex is shame, Till our consenting sires a spouse provide, And public nuptials justify the bride, But would'st thou soon review thy native plain? Attend, and speedy thou shalt pass the main: Nigh where a grove with verdant poplars crown'd, To Pallas sacred, shades the holy ground, We bend our way; a bubbling fount distills A lucid lake, and thence descends in rills; Around the grove, a mead with lively green Falls by degrees, and forms a beauteous scene; Here a rich juice the royal vineyard pours; And there the garden yields a waste of flowers. Hence lies the town, as far as to the ear Floats a strong shout along the waves of air. There wait embower'd, while I ascend alone To great Alcinous on his royal throne.</p></div> </div>
