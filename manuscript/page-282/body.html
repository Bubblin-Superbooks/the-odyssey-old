And e'en these slighted charms might learn to please. A willing goddess, and immortal life. Might banish from thy mind an absent wife. Am I inferior to a mortal dame? Less soft my feature less august my frame? Or shall the daughters of mankind compare Their earth born beauties with the heavenly fair?"</p><p>"Alas! for this (the prudent man replies) Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise? Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art, Forgive the weakness of a human heart.</p></div> </div>
