Haste, rear the mast, the swelling shroud display; Haste, to our ambush'd friends the news convey!"</p><p>Scarce had he spake, when, turning to the strand, Amphinomos survey'd the associate band; Full to the bay within the winding shores With gather'd sails they stood, and lifted oars. "O friends!" he cried, elate with rising joy, "See to the port secure the vessel fly! Some god has told them, or themselves survey The bark escaped; and measure back their way."</p></div> </div>
