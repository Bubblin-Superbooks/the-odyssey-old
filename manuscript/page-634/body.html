<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Succeed my wish, your votary restore: Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore! Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence, And humble all his airs of insolence, Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large, Commences courtier, and neglects his charge."</p><p>"What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;) This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs? The day shall come--nay, 'tis already near-- When, slave! to sell thee at a price too dear Must be my care; and hence transport thee o'er, A load and scandal to this happy shore. Oh! that as surely great Apollo's dart, Or some brave suitor's sword, might pierce the heart Of the proud son; as that we stand this hour In lasting safety from the father's power!"</p></div> </div>
