<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> "Oh be thou dear (Ulysses cried) to Jove, As well thou claim'st a grateful stranger's love!"</p><p>"Be then thy thanks (the bounteous swain replied) Enjoyment of the good the gods provide. From God's own hand descend our joys and woes; These he decrees, and he but suffers those: All power is his, and whatsoe'er he wills, The will itself, omnipotent, fulfils." This said, the first-fruits to the gods he gave; Then pour'd of offer'd wine the sable wave: In great Ulysses' hand he placed the bowl, He sate, and sweet refection cheer'd his soul.</p></div> </div>
