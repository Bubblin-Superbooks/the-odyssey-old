<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>--In ample mode, A robe of military purple flow'd O'er all his frame: illustrious on his breast, The double-clasping gold the king confess'd. In the rich woof a hound, mosaic drawn, Bore on full stretch, and seized a dappled fawn; Deep in the neck his fangs indent their hold; They pant and struggle in the moving gold. Fine as a filmy web beneath it shone A vest, that dazzled like a cloudless sun: The female train who round him throng'd to gaze, In silent wonder sigh'd unwilling praise. A sabre, when the warrior press'd to part, I gave, enamell'd with Vulcanian art: A mantle purple-tinged, and radiant vest, Dimension'd equal to his size, express'd Affection grateful to my honour'd guest.</p></div> </div>
