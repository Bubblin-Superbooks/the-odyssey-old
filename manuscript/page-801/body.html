In the same moment forth Philaetius flies, Secures the court, and with a cable ties The utmost gate (the cable strongly wrought Of Byblos' reed, a ship from Egypt brought); Then unperceived and silent at the board His seat he takes, his eyes upon his lord.</p><p>And now his well-known bow the master bore, Turn'd on all sides, and view'd it o'er and o'er; Lest time or worms had done the weapon wrong, Its owner absent, and untried so long.
