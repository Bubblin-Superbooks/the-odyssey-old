On heaps of death the stern Ulysses stood, All black with dust, and cover'd thick with blood. So the grim lion from the slaughter comes, Dreadful lie glares, and terribly he foams, His breast with marks of carnage painted o'er, His jaws all dropping with the bull's black gore.</p><p>Soon as her eyes the welcome object met, The guilty fall'n, the mighty deed complete; A scream of joy her feeble voice essay'd; The hero check'd her, and composedly said.</p></div> </div>
