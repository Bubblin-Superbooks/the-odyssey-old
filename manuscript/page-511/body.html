In vain! I view perform'd the direful deed, Beeves, slain in heaps, along the ocean bleed.</p><p>"Now heaven gave signs of wrath: along the ground Crept the raw hides, and with a bellowing sound Roar'd the dead limbs; the burning entrails groan'd. Six guilty days my wretched mates employ In impious feasting, and unhallowed joy; The seventh arose, and now the sire of gods Rein'd the rough storms;</p></div> </div>
