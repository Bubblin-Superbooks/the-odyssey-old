But instant bid Autonoe descend, Instant Hippodame our steps attend; Ill suits it female virtue, to be seen Alone, indecent, in the walks of men."</p><p>Then while Eurynome the mandate bears, From heaven Minerva shoots with guardian cares; O'er all her senses, as the couch she press'd, She pours, a pleasing, deep and death-like rest, With every beauty every feature arms, Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms; In her love-darting eyes awakes the fires (Immortal gifts! to kindle soft desires); From limb to limb an air majestic sheds, And the pure ivory o'er her bosom spreads. Such Venus shines, when with a measured bound She smoothly gliding swims the harmonious round, When with the Graces in the dance she moves, And fires the gazing gods with ardent loves.</p></div> </div>
