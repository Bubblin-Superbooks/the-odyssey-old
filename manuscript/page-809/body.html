<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Unkind, the fond illusion to impose! Was it to flatter or deride my woes? Never did I sleep so sweet enjoy, Since my dear lord left Ithaca for Troy. Why must I wake to grieve, and curse thy shore, O Troy?--may never tongue pronounce thee more! Begone! another might have felt our rage, But age is sacred, and we spare thy age."</p><p>To whom with warmth: "My soul a lie disdains; Ulysses lives, thy own Ulysses reigns: That stranger, patient of the suitors' wrongs, And the rude license of ungovern'd tongues! He, he is thine! Thy son his latent guest Long knew, but lock'd the secret in his breast: With well concerted art to end his woes, And burst at once in vengeance on the foes."</p></div> </div>
