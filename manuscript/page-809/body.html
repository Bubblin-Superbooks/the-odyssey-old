<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> While, to your lust and spoil a guardless prey, Our house, our wealth, our helpless handmaids lay: Not so content, with bolder frenzy fired, E'en to our bed presumptuous you aspired: Laws or divine or human fail'd to move, Or shame of men, or dread of gods above; Heedless alike of infamy or praise, Or Fame's eternal voice in future days; The hour of vengeance, wretches, now is come; Impending fate is yours, and instant doom."</p><p>Thus dreadful he. Confused the suitors stood, From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood: Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide. Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:</p><p>"If, as thy words import (he thus began), Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man, Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd In thy spoil'd palace, and exhausted land;</p></div> </div>
