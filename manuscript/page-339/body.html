<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Full fifty handmaids form the household train; Some turn the mill, or sift the golden grain; Some ply the loom; their busy fingers move Like poplar-leaves when Zephyr fans the grove. Not more renown'd the men of Scheria's isle For sailing arts and all the naval toil, Than works of female skill their women's pride, The flying shuttle through the threads to guide: Pallas to these her double gifts imparts, Incentive genius, and industrious arts.</p><p>Close to the gates a spacious garden lies, From storms defended and inclement skies. Four acres was the allotted space of ground, Fenced with a green enclosure all around. Tall thriving trees confess'd the fruitful mould: The reddening apple ripens here to gold.</p></div> </div>
