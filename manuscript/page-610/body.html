<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Yet strive by prayer and counsel to restrain Their lawless insults, though thou strive in vain: For wicked ears are deaf to wisdom's call, And vengeance strikes whom Heaven has doom'd to fall. Once more attend: when she whose power inspires The thinking mind, my soul to vengeance fires, I give the sign: that instant, from beneath, Aloft convey the instruments of death, Armour and arms; and, if mistrust arise, Thus veil the truth in plausible disguise:</p><p>"'These glittering weapons, ere he sail'd to Troy, Ulysses view'd with stern heroic joy: Then, beaming o'er the illumined wall they shone; Now dust dishonours, all their lustre gone. I bear them hence (so Jove my soul inspires), From the pollution of the fuming fires; Lest when the bowl inflames, in vengeful mood Ye rush to arms, and stain the feast with blood: Oft ready swords in luckless hour incite The hand of wrath, and arm it for the fight.'</p></div> </div>
