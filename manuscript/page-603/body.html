<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Review the series of our lives, and taste The melancholy joy of evils pass'd: For he who much has suffer'd, much will know, And pleased remembrance builds delight on woe.</p><p>"Above Ortygia lies an isle of fame, Far hence remote, and Syria is the name (There curious eyes inscribed with wonder trace The sun's diurnal, and his annual race); Not large, but fruitful; stored with grass to keep The bellowing oxen and the bleating sheep; Her sloping hills the mantling vines adorn, And her rich valleys wave with golden corn. No want, no famine, the glad natives know, Nor sink by sickness to the shades below; But when a length of years unnerves the strong, Apollo comes, and Cynthia comes along. They bend the silver bow with tender skill, And, void of pain, the silent arrows kill. Two equal tribes this fertile land divide, Where two fair cities rise with equal pride.</p></div> </div>
