In vain! I view perform'd the direful deed, Beeves, slain in heaps, along the ocean bleed.</p><p>"Now heaven gave signs of wrath: along the ground Crept the raw hides, and with a bellowing sound Roar'd the dead limbs; the burning entrails groan'd. Six guilty days my wretched mates employ In impious feasting, and unhallowed joy; The seventh arose, and now the sire of gods Rein'd the rough storms; and calm'd the tossing floods: With speed the bark we climb; the spacious sails. Loosed from the yards invite the impelling gales. Past sight of shore, along the surge we bound, And all above is sky, and ocean all around; When lo! a murky cloud the thunderer forms Full o'er our heads, and blackens heaven with storms.</p></div> </div>
