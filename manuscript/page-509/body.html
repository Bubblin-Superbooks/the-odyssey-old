<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>To whom the Father of the immortal powers, Who swells the clouds, and gladdens earth with showers, "Can mighty Neptune thus of man complain? Neptune, tremendous o'er the boundless main! Revered and awful e'en in heaven's abodes, Ancient and great! a god above the gods! If that low race offend thy power divine (Weak, daring creatures!) is not vengeance thine? Go, then, the guilty at thy will chastise." He said. The shaker of the earth replies:</p><p>"This then, I doom: to fix the gallant ship, A mark of vengeance on the sable deep; To warn the thoughtless, self-confiding train, No more unlicensed thus to brave the main. Full in their port a Shady hill shall rise, If such thy will."--" We will it (Jove replies). E'en when with transport blackening all the strand, The swarming people hail their ship to land, Fix her for ever, a memorial stone: Still let her seem to sail, and seem alone. The trembling crowds shall see the sudden shade Of whelming mountains overhang their head!"</p></div> </div>
