<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Such were they youths I had they to manhood grown Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne, But ere the harvest of the beard began To bristle on the chin, and promise man, His shafts Apollo aim'd; at once they sound, And stretch the giant monsters o'er the ground.</p><p>"There mournful Phaedra with sad Procris moves, Both beauteous shades, both hapless in their loves; And near them walk'd with solemn pace and slow, Sad Adriadne, partner of their woe: The royal Minos Ariadne bred, She Theseus loved, from Crete with Theseus fled: Swift to the Dian isle the hero flies, And towards his Athens bears the lovely prize; There Bacchus with fierce rage Diana fires, The goddess aims her shaft, the nymph expires.</p></div> </div>
