Phaeacians bore me to the port assign'd, A nation ever to the stranger kind; Wrapp'd in the embrace of sleep, the faithful train O'er seas convey'd me to my native reign: Embroider'd vestures, gold, and brass, are laid Conceal'd in caverns in the sylvan shade. Hither, intent the rival rout to slay, And plan the scene of death, I bend my way; So Pallas wills--but thou, my son, explain The names and numbers of the audacious train; 'Tis mine to judge if better to employ Assistant force, or singly to destroy."</p></div> </div>
