What power becalms the innavigable seas? What guilt provokes him, and what vows appease?'</p><p>"I ceased, when affable the goddess cried: 'Observe, and in the truths I speak confide; The oracular seer frequents the Pharian coast, From whose high bed my birth divine I boast; Proteus, a name tremendous o'er the main, The delegate of Neptune's watery reign.
