Thus feasting high, Alcinous gave the sign, And bade the herald pour the rosy wine; "Let all around the due libation pay To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way."</p><p>He said. Pontonous heard the king's command; The circling goblet moves from hand to hand; Each drinks the juice that glads the heart of man. Alcinous then, with aspect mild, began:</p><p>"Princes and peers, attend; while we impart To you the thoughts of no inhuman heart. Now pleased and satiate from the social rite Repair we to the blessings of the night; But with the rising day, assembled here, Let all the elders of the land appear, Pious observe our hospitable laws, And Heaven propitiate in the stranger's cause;</p></div> </div>
