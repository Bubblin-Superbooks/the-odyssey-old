Or say in Pyle? for yet he views the light, Nor glides a phantom through the realms of night.'</p><p>"Then I: 'Thy suit is vain, nor can I say If yet he breathes in realms of cheerful day; Or pale or wan beholds these nether skies; Truth I revere; for wisdom never lies.'</p><p>"Thus in a tide of tears our sorrows flow, And add new horror to the realms of woe; Till side by side along the dreary coast Advanced Achilles' and Patroclus' ghost, A friendly pair! near these the Pylian stray'd, And towering Ajax, an illustrious shade! War was his joy, and pleased with loud alarms, None but Pelides brighter shone in arms.</p></div> </div>
