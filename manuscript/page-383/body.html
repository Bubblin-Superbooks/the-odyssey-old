Declare thy name: not mortal is this juice, Such as the unbless'd Cyclopaean climes produce (Though sure our vine the largest cluster yields, And Jove's scorn'd thunder serves to drench our fields); But this descended from the bless'd abodes, A rill of nectar, streaming from the gods.'</p><p>"He said, and greedy grasped the heady bowl, Thrice drained, and poured the deluge on his soul. His sense lay covered with the dozy fume; While thus my fraudful speech I reassume.</p></div> </div>
