<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"O'er earth (returns the prince) resounds thy name, Thy well-tried wisdom, and thy martial fame, Yet at thy words I start, in wonder lost; Can we engage, not decades but an host? Can we alone in furious battle stand, Against that numerous and determined band? Hear then their numbers; from Dulichium came Twice twenty-six, all peers of mighty name. Six are their menial train: twice twelve the boast Of Samos; twenty from Zacynthus' coast: And twelve our country's pride; to these belong Medon and Phemius, skill'd in heavenly song. Two sewers from day to day the revels wait, Exact of taste, and serve the feast in state. With such a foe the unequal fight to try, Were by false courage unrevenged to die. Then what assistant powers you boast relate, Ere yet we mingle in the stern debate."</p></div> </div>
