Now with the dawn, from his adjoining home, Was Boethoedes Eteoneus come; Swift at the word he forms the rising blaze, And o'er the coals the smoking fragments lays. Meantime the king, his son, and Helen went Where the rich wardrobe breathed a costly scent; The king selected from the glittering rows A bowl; the prince a silver beaker chose.

This silver bowl, whose costly margins shine Enchased with old, this valued gift be thine;</p></div> </div>
