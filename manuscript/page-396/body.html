Then they sail to the Laestrygons, where they lose eleven ships, and, with only one remaining, proceed to the island of Circe. Eurylochus is sent first with some companions, all which, except Eurylochus, are transformed into swine. Ulysses then undertakes the adventure, and, by the help of Mercury, who gives him the herb Moly, overcomes the enchantress, and procures the restoration of his men. After a year's stay with her, he prepares, at her instigation, for his voyage to the infernal shades.</p><p>"AT length we reach'd AEolias's sea-girt shore, Where great Hippotades the sceptre bore, A floating isle! high-raised by toil divine, Strong walls of brass the rocky coast confine.</p></div> </div>
