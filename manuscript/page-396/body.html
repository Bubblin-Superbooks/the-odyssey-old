<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>presides, Safe as they pass, and safe repass the tides, With fury burns; while careless they convey Promiscuous every guest to every bay, These ears have heard my royal sire disclose A dreadful story, big with future woes; How Neptune raged, and how, by his command, Firm rooted in a surge a ship should stand A monument of wrath; how mound on mound Should bury these proud towers beneath the ground. But this the gods may frustrate or fulfil, As suits the purpose of the Eternal Will.</p></div> </div>
