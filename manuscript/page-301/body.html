To this calm port the glad Ulysses press'd, And hail'd the river, and its god address'd:</p><p>"Whoe'er thou art, before whose stream unknown I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne, Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain To thee from Neptune and the raging main Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me, For sacred even to gods is misery: Let then thy waters give the weary rest, And save a suppliant, and a man distress'd."</p></div> </div>
