So when the woodman's toil her cave surrounds, And with the hunter's cry the grove resounds, With grief and rage the mother-lion stung. Fearless herself, yet trembles for her young While pensive in the silent slumberous shade, Sleep's gentle powers her drooping eyes invade; Minerva, life-like, on embodied air Impress'd the form of Iphthima the fair; (Icarius' daughter she, whose blooming charms Allured Eumelus to her virgin arms; A sceptred lord, who o'er the fruitful plain Of Thessaly wide stretched his ample reign:) As Pallas will'd, along the sable skies, To calm the queen, the phantom sister flies. Swift on the regal dome, descending right, The bolted valves are pervious to her flight. Close to her head the pleasing vision stands, And thus performs Minerva's high commands</p></div> </div>
