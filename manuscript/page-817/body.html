Go you, and seize the felon; backward bind His arms and legs, and fix a plank behind: On this his body by strong cords extend, And on a column near the roof suspend: So studied tortures his vile days shall end."</p><p>The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste, Behind the felon unperceived they pass'd, As round the room in quest of arms he goes (The half-shut door conceal'd his lurking foes): One hand sustain'd a helm, and one the shield Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield, Cover'd with dust, with dryness chapp'd and worn, The brass corroded, and the leather torn.</p></div> </div>
