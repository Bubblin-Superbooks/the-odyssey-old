There hecacombs of bulls, to Neptune slain, High-flaming please the monarch of the main. The fourth day shone, when all their labours o'er, Tydides' vessels touched the wish'd-for shore. But I to Pylos scud before the gales, The god still breathing on my swelling sails; Separate from all, I safely landed here; Their fates or fortunes never reach'd my ear. Yet what I learn'd, attend; as here I sat, And ask'd each voyager each hero's fate; Curious to know, and willing to relate.</p><p>"Safe reach'd the Myrmidons their native land, Beneath Achilles' warlike son's command.</p></div> </div>
