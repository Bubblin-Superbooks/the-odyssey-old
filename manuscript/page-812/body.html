<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> His falling hand deserts the lifted sword, And prone he falls extended o'er the board! Before him wide, in mix'd effusion roll The untasted viands, and the jovial bowl. Full through his liver pass'd the mortal wound, With dying rage his forehead beats the ground; He spurn'd the seat with fury as he fell, And the fierce soul to darkness dived, and hell. Next bold Amphinomus his arm extends To force the pass; the godlike man defends. Thy spear, Telemachus, prevents the attack, The brazen weapon driving through his back. Thence through his breast its bloody passage tore; Flat falls he thundering on the marble floor, And his crush'd forehead marks the stone with gore. He left his javelin in the dead, for fear The long encumbrance of the weighty spear To the fierce foe advantage might afford, To rash between and use the shorten'd sword.</p></div> </div>
