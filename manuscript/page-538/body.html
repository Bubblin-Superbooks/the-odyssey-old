<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Little, alas! was left my wretched share, Except a house, a covert from the air: But what by niggard fortune was denied, A willing widow's copious wealth supplied. My valour was my plea, a gallant mind, That, true to honour, never lagg'd behind (The sex is ever to a soldier kind). Now wasting years my former strength confound, And added woes have bow'd me to the ground; Yet by the stubble you may guess the grain, And mark the ruins of no vulgar man. Me, Pallas gave to lead the martial storm, And the fair ranks of battle to deform; Me, Mars inspired to turn the foe to flight, And tempt the secret ambush of the night. Let ghastly Death in all his forms appear, I saw him not, it was not mine to fear. Before the rest I raised my ready steel, The first I met, he yielded, or he fell. But works of peace my soul disdain'd to bear, The rural labour, or domestic care.</p></div> </div>
