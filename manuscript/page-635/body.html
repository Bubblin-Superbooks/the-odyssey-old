<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The bread from canisters Mesaulius gave (Eumaeus' proper treasure bought this slave, And led from Taphos, to attend his board, A servant added to his absent lord); His task it was the wheaten loaves to lay, And from the banquet take the bowls away. And now the rage of hunger was repress'd, And each betakes him to his couch to rest.</p><p>Now came the night, and darkness cover'd o'er The face of things; the winds began to roar; The driving storm the watery west-wind pours, And Jove descends in deluges of showers.</p></div> </div>
