There, as the night in silence roll'd away, A heaven of charms divine Nausicaa lay: Through the thick gloom the shining portals blaze; Two nymphs the portals guard, each nymph a Grace, Light as the viewless air the warrior maid Glides through the valves, and hovers round her head; A favourite virgin's blooming form she took, From Dymas sprung, and thus the vision spoke:</p><p>"Oh Indolent! to waste thy hours away! And sleep'st thou careless of the bridal day! Thy spousal ornament neglected lies; Arise, prepare the bridal train, arise! A just applause the cares of dress impart, And give soft transport to a parent's heart.</p></div> </div>
