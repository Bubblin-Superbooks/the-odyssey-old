(thus began, Low at her knees, the much-enduring man) To thee, thy consort, and this royal train, To all that share the blessings of your reign, A suppliant bends: oh pity human woe! 'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe. A wretched exile to his country send, Long worn with griefs, and long without a friend So may the gods your better days increase, And all your joys descend on all your race; So reign for ever on your country's breast, Your people blessing, by your people bless'd!"</p><p>Then to the genial hearth he bow'd his face, And humbled in the ashes took his place. Silence ensued. The eldest first began, Echeneus sage, a venerable man! Whose well-taught mind the present age surpass'd, And join'd to that the experience of the last. Fit words attended on his weighty sense, And mild persuasion flow'd in eloquence.</p></div> </div>
