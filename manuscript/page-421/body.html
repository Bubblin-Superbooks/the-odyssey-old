Then pleased, and whistling, drives his flock before, Removes the rocky mountain from the door, And shuts again: with equal ease disposed, As a light quiver's lid is oped and closed. His giant voice the echoing region fills: His flocks, obedient, spread o'er all the hills.</p><p>"Thus left behind, even in the last despair I thought, devised, and Pallas heard my prayer. Revenge, and doubt, and caution, work'd my breast; But this of many counsels seem'd the best: The monster's club within the cave I spied, A tree of stateliest growth, and yet undried, Green from the wood: of height and bulk so vast, The largest ship might claim it for a mast.</p></div> </div>
