<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For so reported the first man I view'd (Some surly islander, of manners rude), Nor farther conference vouchsafed to stay; Heedless he whistled, and pursued his way. But thou whom years have taught to understand, Humanely hear, and answer my demand: A friend I seek, a wise one and a brave: Say, lives he yet, or moulders in the grave? Time was (my fortunes then were at the best) When at my house I lodged this foreign guest; He said, from Ithaca's fair isle he came, And old Laertes was his father's name. To him, whatever to a guest is owed I paid, and hospitable gifts bestow'd: To him seven talents of pure ore I told, Twelve cloaks, twelve vests, twelve tunics stiff with gold: A bowl, that rich with polish'd silver flames, And skill'd in female works, four lovely dames."</p></div> </div>
