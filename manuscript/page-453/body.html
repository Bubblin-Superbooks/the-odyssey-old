<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> An ell in length the pliant wisp I weaved, And the huge body on my shoulders heaved: Then leaning on my spear with both my hands, Upbore my load, and press'd the sinking sands With weighty steps, till at the ship I threw The welcome burden, and bespoke my crew:</p><p>"'Cheer up, my friends! it is not yet our fate To glide with ghosts through Pluto's gloomy gate. Food in the desert land, behold! is given! Live, and enjoy the providence of heaven.'</p><p>"The joyful crew survey his mighty size, And on the future banquet feast their eyes, As huge in length extended lay the beast; Then wash their hands, and hasten to the feast. There, till the setting sun roll'd down the light, They sate indulging in the genial rite.</p></div> </div>
