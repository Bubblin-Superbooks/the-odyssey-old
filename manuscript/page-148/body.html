<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We with the rising morn our ships unmoor'd, And brought our captives and our stores aboard; But half the people with respect obey'd The king of men, and at his bidding stay'd. Now on the wings of winds our course we keep (For God had smooth'd the waters of the deep); For Tenedos we spread our eager oars, There land, and pay due victims to the powers; To bless our safe return, we join in prayer; But angry Jove dispersed our vows in air, And raised new discord. Then (so Heaven decreed) Ulysses first and Neator disagreed! Wise as he was, by various counsels away'd, He there, though late, to please the monarch, stay'd. But I, determined, stem the foamy floods, Warn'd of the coming fury of the gods.</p></div> </div>
