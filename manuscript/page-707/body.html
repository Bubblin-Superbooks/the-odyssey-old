Not so a youth, who deals the goblet round, Full on his shoulder it inflicts a wound; Dash'd from his hand the sounding goblet flies, He shrieks, he reels, he falls, and breathless lies. Then wild uproar and clamour mount the sky, Till mutual thus the peers indignant cry: "Oh had this stranger sunk to realms beneath, To the black realms of darkness and of death, Ere yet he trod these shores! to strife he draws Peer against peer; and what the weighty cause? A vagabond! for him the great destroy, In vile ignoble jars, the feast of joy."</p></div> </div>
