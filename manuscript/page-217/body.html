So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall, The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall, The partners of his fame and toils at Troy, Around their lord, a mighty ruin, lie: Mix'd with the brave, the base invaders bleed; Aegysthus sole survives to boast the deed."</p><p>He said: chill horrors shook my shivering soul, Rack'd wish convulsive pangs in dust I roll; And hate, in madness of extreme despair, To view the sun, or breathe the vital air. But when, superior to the rage of woe, I stood restored and tears had ceased to flow, Lenient of grief the pitying god began: 'Forget the brother, and resume the man. To Fate's supreme dispose the dead resign, That care be Fate's, a speedy passage thine Still lives the wretch who wrought the death deplored, But lives a victim for thy vengeful sword;</p></div> </div>
