<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O son of Neleus! awful Nestor, tell How he, the mighty Agamemnon, fell; By what strange fraud Aegysthus wrought, relate (By force he could not) such a hero's fate? Live Menelaus not in Greece? or where Was then the martial brother's pious care? Condemn'd perhaps some foreign short to tread; Or sure Aegysthus had not dared the deed." To whom the full of days: Illustrious youth, Attend (though partly thou hast guess'd) the truth. For had the martial Menelaus found The ruffian breathing yet on Argive ground; Nor earth had bid his carcase from the skies, Nor Grecian virgins shriek'd his obsequies, But fowls obscene dismember'd his remains, And dogs had torn him on the naked plains.</p></div> </div>
