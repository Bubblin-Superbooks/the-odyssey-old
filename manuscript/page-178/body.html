<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nor want of herbage makes the dairy fail, But every season fills the foaming pail. Whilst, heaping unwash'd wealth, I distant roam, The best of brothers, at his natal home, By the dire fury of a traitress wife, Ends the sad evening of a stormy life; Whence, with incessant grief my soul annoy'd, These riches are possess'd, but not enjoy'd! My wars, the copious theme of every tongue, To you your fathers have recorded long. How favouring Heaven repaid my glorious toils With a sack'd palace, and barbaric spoils. Oh! had the gods so large a boon denied And life, the just equivalent supplied To those brave warriors, who, with glory fired Far from their country, in my cause expired! Still in short intervals of pleasing woe. Regardful of the friendly dues I owe, I to the glorious dead, for ever dear! Indulge the tribute of a grateful tear.</p></div> </div>
