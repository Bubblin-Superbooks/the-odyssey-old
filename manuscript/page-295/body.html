<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And now a single beam the chief bestrides: There poised a while above the bounding tides, His limbs discumbers of the clinging vest, And binds the sacred cincture round his breast: Then prone an ocean in a moment flung, Stretch'd wide his eager arms, and shot the seas along. All naked now, on heaving billows laid, Stern Neptune eyed him, and contemptuous said:</p><p>"Go, learn'd in woes, and other foes essay! Go, wander helpless on the watery way; Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then (If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men. Whate'er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise Shall last remember'd in thy best of days."</p></div> </div>
