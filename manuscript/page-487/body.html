'tis death to hear! Firm to the mast with chains thyself be bound, Nor trust thy virtue to the enchanting sound. If, mad with transport, freedom thou demand, Be every fetter strain'd, and added band to band.</p><p>"'These seas o'erpass'd, be wise! but I refrain To mark distinct thy voyage o'er the main: New horrors rise! let prudence be thy guide, And guard thy various passage through the tide.</p><p>"'High o'er the main two rocks exalt their brow,' The boiling billows thundering roll below; Through the vast waves the dreadful wonders move, Hence named Erratic by the gods above.</p></div> </div>
