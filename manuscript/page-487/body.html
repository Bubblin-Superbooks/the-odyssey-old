<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> New wine, with honey-temper'd milk, we bring, Then living waters from the crystal spring: O'er these was strew'd the consecrated flour, And on the surface shone the holy store.</p><p>"Now the wan shades we hail, the infernal gods, To speed our course, and waft us o'er the floods: So shall a barren heifer from the stall Beneath the knife upon your altars fall; So in our palace, at our safe return, Rich with unnumber'd gifts the pile shall burn; So shall a ram, the largest of the breed, Black as these regions, to Tiresias bleed.</p><p>"Thus solemn rites and holy vows we paid To all the phantom-nations of the dead; Then died the sheep: a purple torrent flow'd, And all the caverns smoked with streaming blood.</p></div> </div>
