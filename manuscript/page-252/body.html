<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For him the nymph a rich repast ordains, Such as the mortal life of man sustains; Before herself were placed the the cates divine, Ambrosial banquet and celestial wine. Their hunger satiate, and their thirst repress'd, Thus spoke Calypso to her godlike guest:</p><p>"Ulysses! (with a sigh she thus began;) O sprung from gods! in wisdom more than man! Is then thy home the passion of thy heart? Thus wilt thou leave me, are we thus to part? Farewell! and ever joyful mayst thou be, Nor break the transport with one thought of me. But ah, Ulysses! wert thou given to know What Fate yet dooms these still to undergo, Thy heart might settle in this scene of ease. And e'en these slighted charms might learn to please. A willing goddess, and immortal life. Might banish from thy mind an absent wife.</p></div> </div>
