But mercy to the poor and stranger show, Lest Heaven in vengeance send some mightier woe."</p><p>Scornful he spoke, and o'er his shoulder flung The broad-patch'd scrip in tatters hung Ill join'd, and knotted to a twisted thong. Then, turning short, disdain'd a further stay; But to the palace measured back the way. There, as he rested gathering in a ring, The peers with smiles address'd their unknown king: "Stranger, may Jove and all the aerial powers With every blessing crown thy happy hours! Our freedom to thy prowess'd arm we owe From bold intrusion of thy coward foe: Instant the flying sail the slave shall wing To Eschetus, the monster of a king."</p></div> </div>
