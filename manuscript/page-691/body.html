<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In sweet oblivion let my sorrows sleep! My woes awaked, will violate your ear, And to this gay censorious train appear A whiny vapour melting in a tear."</p><p>"Their gifts the gods resumed (the queen rejoin'd), Exterior grace, and energy of mind, When the dear partner of my nuptial joy, Auxiliar troops combined, to conquer Troy. My lord's protecting hand alone would raise My drooping verdure, and extend my praise! Peers from the distant Samian shore resort: Here with Dulichians join'd, besiege the court: Zacynthus, green with ever-shady groves, And Ithaca, presumptuous, boast their loves: Obtruding on my choice a second lord, They press the Hymenaean rite abhorr'd. Misrule thus mingling with domestic cares, I live regardless of my state affairs; Receive no stranger-guest, no poor relieve;</p></div> </div>
