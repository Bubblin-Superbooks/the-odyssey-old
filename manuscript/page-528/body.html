So may the god reverse his purposed will, Nor o'er our city hang the dreadful hill."</p><p>The monarch spoke: they trembled and obey'd, Forth on the sands the victim oxen led; The gathered tribes before the altars stand, And chiefs and rulers, a majestic band. The king of ocean all the tribes implore; The blazing altars redden all the shore.</p></div> </div>
