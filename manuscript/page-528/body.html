<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O why was I victorious in the strife? O dear bought honour with so brave a life! With him the strength of war, the soldier's pride, Our second hope to great Achilles, died! Touch'd at the sight from tears I scarce refrain, And tender sorrow thrills in every vein; Pensive and sad I stand, at length accost With accents mild the inexorable ghost: 'Still burns thy rage? and can brave souls resent E'en after death? Relent, great shade, relent! Perish those arms which by the gods' decree Accursed our army with the loss of thee! With thee we fall; Greece wept thy hapless fates, And shook astonish'd through her hundred states; Not more, when great Achilles press'd the ground, And breathed his manly spirit through the wound.</p></div> </div>
