<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> From realm to realm, a nation to explore Who ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar, Nor saw gay vessel storm the surgy plain, A painted wonder, flying on the main: An oar my hand must bear; a shepherd eyes The unknown instrument with strange surprise, And calls a corn-van; this upon the plain I fix, and hail the monarch of the main; Then bathe his altars with the mingled gore Of victims vow'd, a ram, a bull, a boar; Thence swift re-sailing to my native shores, Due victims slay to all the ethereal powers. Then Heaven decrees, in peace to end my days And steal myself from life by slow decays! Unknown to pain, in age resign my breath, When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death; To the dark grave retiring as to rest; My people blessing, by my people bless'd. Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display By their dread seer, and such my future day."</p></div> </div>
