<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Like me had Helen fear'd, with wanton charms Ere the fair mischief set two worlds in arms; Ere Greece rose dreadful in the avenging day; Thus had she fear'd, she had not gone astray. But Heaven, averse to Greece, in wrath decreed That she should wander, and that Greece should bleed: Blind to the ills that from injustice flow, She colour'd all our wretched lives with woe. But why these sorrows when my lord arrives? I yield, I yield! my own Ulysses lives! The secrets of the bridal bed are known To thee, to me, to Actoris alone (My father's present in the spousal hour, The sole attendant on our genial bower). Since what no eye hath seen thy tongue reveal'd, Hard and distrustful as I am, I yield."</p><p>Touch'd to the soul, the king with rapture hears, Hangs round her neck, and speaks his joy in tears.</p></div> </div>
