Confused the suitors stood, From their pale cheeks recedes the flying blood: Trembling they sought their guilty heads to hide. Alone the bold Eurymachus replied:</p><p>"If, as thy words import (he thus began), Ulysses lives, and thou the mighty man, Great are thy wrongs, and much hast thou sustain'd In thy spoil'd palace, and exhausted land; The cause and author of those guilty deeds, Lo! at thy feet unjust Antinous bleeds Not love, but wild ambition was his guide; To slay thy son, thy kingdom to divide, These were his aims;</p></div> </div>
