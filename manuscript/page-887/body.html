The rest acknowledge their master with all demonstrations of joy.</p><p>Then fierce the hero o'er the threshold strode; Stripp'd of his rags, he blazed out like a god. Full in their face the lifted bow he bore, And quiver'd deaths, a formidable store; Before his feet the rattling shower he threw, And thus, terrific, to the suitor-crew:</p><p>"One venturous game this hand hath won to-day, Another, princes! yet remains to play; Another mark our arrow must attain. Phoebus, assist! nor be the labour vain.</p></div> </div>
