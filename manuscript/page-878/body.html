To whom, insensate, dost thou bear the bow? Exiled for this to some sequester'd den, Far from the sweet society of men, To thy own dogs a prey thou shalt be made; If Heaven and Phoebus lend the suitors aid." Thus they. Aghast he laid the weapon down, But bold Telemachus thus urged him on: "Proceed, false slave, and slight their empty words: What! hopes the fool to please so many lords? Young as I am, thy prince's vengeful hand Stretch'd forth in wrath shall drive thee from the land. Oh! could the vigour of this arm as well The oppressive suitors from my walls expel! Then what a shoal of lawless men should go To fill with tumult the dark courts below!"</p></div> </div>
