(Respectful thus Eurymachus rejoin'd,) Moved by no weak surmise, but sense of shame, We dread the all-arraigning voice of Fame: We dread the censure of the meanest slave, The weakest woman: all can wrong the brave. 'Behold what wretches to the bed pretend Of that brave chief whose bow they could not bend! In came a beggar of the strolling crew, And did what all those princes could not do.' Thus will the common voice our deed defame, And thus posterity upbraid our name."</p></div> </div>
