Though with a grace divine her soul is blest, And all Minerva breathes within her breast, In wondrous arts than woman more renown'd, And more than woman with deep wisdom crown'd; Though Tyro nor Mycene match her name, Not great Alemena (the proud boasts of fame); Yet thus by heaven adorn'd, by heaven's decree She shines with fatal excellence, to thee: With thee, the bowl we drain, indulge the feast, Till righteous heaven reclaim her stubborn breast. What though from pole to pole resounds her name! The son's destruction waits the mother's fame: For, till she leaves thy court, it is decreed, Thy bowl to empty and thy flock to bleed."</p></div> </div>
