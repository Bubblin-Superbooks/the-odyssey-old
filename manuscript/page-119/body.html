<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> By all the deathless powers that reign above, By righteous Themis and by thundering Jove (Themis, who gives to councils, or denies Success; and humbles, or confirms the wise), Rise in my aid! suffice the tears that flow For my lost sire, nor add new woe to woe. If e'er he bore the sword to strengthen ill, Or, having power to wrong, betray'd the will, On me, on me your kindled wrath assuage, And bid the voice of lawless riot rage. If ruin to your royal race ye doom, Be you the spoilers, and our wealth consume. Then might we hope redress from juster laws, And raise all Ithaca to aid our cause: But while your sons commit the unpunish'd wrong, You make the arm of violence too strong."</p><p>While thus he spoke, with rage and grief he frown'd, And dash'd the imperial sceptre to the ground.</p></div> </div>
