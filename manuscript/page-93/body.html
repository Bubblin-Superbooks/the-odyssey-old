Oh, snatch some portion of these acts from fate, Celestial Muse! and to our world relate.</p><p>Now at their native realms the Greeks arrived; All who the wars of ten long years survived; And 'scaped the perils of the gulfy main. Ulysses, sole of all the victor train, An exile from his dear paternal coast, Deplored his absent queen and empire lost. Calypso in her caves constrain'd his stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay; In vain-for now the circling years disclose The day predestined to reward his woes.</p></div> </div>
