By farther toils decreed the brave to try, And level poised the wings of victory; Then with a change of form eludes their sight, Perch'd like a swallow on a rafter's height, And unperceived enjoys the rising fight.</p><p>Damastor's son, bold Agelaus, leads, The guilty war, Eurynomus succeeds; With these, Pisander, great Polyctor's son, Sage Polybus, and stern Amphimedon, With Demoptolemus: these six survive: The best of all the shafts had left alive. Amidst the carnage, desperate as they stand, Thus Agelaus roused the lagging band:</p><p>"The hour has come, when yon fierce man no more With bleeding princes shall bestrew the floor; Lo! Mentor leaves him with an empty boast; The four remain, but four against an host.</p></div> </div>
