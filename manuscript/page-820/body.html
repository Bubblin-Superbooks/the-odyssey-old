What hopest thou here? Thee first the sword shall slay, Then lop thy whole posterity away; Far hence thy banish'd consort shall we send; With his thy forfeit lands and treasures blend; Thus, and thus only, shalt thou join thy friend."</p><p>His barbarous insult even the goddess fires, Who thus the warrior to revenge inspires:</p><p>"Art thou Ulysses? where then shall we find The patient body and the constant mind? That courage, once the Trojans' daily dread, Known nine long years, and felt by heroes dead? And where that conduct, which revenged the lust Of Priam's race, and laid proud Troy in dust? If this, when Helen was the cause, were done; What for thy country now, thy queen, thy son? Rise then in combat, at my side attend; Observe what vigour gratitude can lend, And foes how weak, opposed against a friend!"</p></div> </div>
