<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For now the soft enchantress pleased no more; For now, reluctant, and constrained by charms, Absent he lay in her desiring arms, In slumber wore the heavy night away, On rocks and shores consumed the tedious day; There sate all desolate, and sighed alone, With echoing sorrows made the mountains groan. And roll'd his eyes o'er all the restless main, Till, dimmed with rising grief, they streamed again.</p><p>Here, on his musing mood the goddess press'd, Approaching soft, and thus the chief address'd: "Unhappy man! to wasting woes a prey, No more in sorrows languish life away: Free as the winds I give thee now to rove: Go, fell the timber of yon lofty grove, And form a raft, and build the rising ship, Sublime to bear thee o'er the gloomy deep.</p></div> </div>
