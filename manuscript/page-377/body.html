At length, with heart recover'd, I began:</p><p>"'From Troy's famed fields, sad wanderers o'er the main, Behold the relics of the Grecian train: Through various seas, by various perils toss'd, And forced by storms, unwilling on your coast; Far from our destined course and native land, Such was our fate, and such high Jove's command! Nor what we are befits us to disclaim, Atrides' friends (in arms a mighty name), Who taught proud Troy and all her sons to bow; Victors of late, but humble suppliants now! Low at thy knee thy succour we implore; Respect us, human, and relieve us, poor. At least, some hospitable gift bestow; 'Tis what the happy to the unhappy owe; 'Tis what the gods require: those gods revere; The poor and stranger are their constant care; To Jove their cause, and their revenge belongs, He wanders with them, and he feels their wrongs."</p></div> </div>
