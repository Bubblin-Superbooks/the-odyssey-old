No sooner freed, and through the inclosure pass'd, First I release myself, my fellows last: Fat sheep and goats in throngs we drive before, And reach our vessel on the winding shore. With joy the sailors view their friends return'd, And hail us living whom as dead they mourn'd Big tears of transport stand in every eye: I check their fondness, and command to fly. Aboard in haste they heave the wealthy sheep, And snatch their oars, and rush into the deep. "Now off at sea, and from the shallows clear, As far as human voice could reach the ear, With taunts the distant giant I accost: 'Hear me, O Cyclop! hear, ungracious host! 'Twas on no coward, no ignoble slave, Thou meditatest thy meal in yonder cave; But one, the vengeance fated from above Doom'd to inflict; the instrument of Jove. Thy barbarous breach of hospitable bands, The god, the god revenges by my hands.'</p></div> </div>
