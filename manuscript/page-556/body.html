There, sacred to the radiant god of day, Graze the fair herds, the flocks promiscuous stray: Then suddenly was heard along the main To low the ox, to blest the woolly train. Straight to my anxious thoughts the sound convey'd The words of Circe and the Theban shade; Warn'd by their awful voice these shores to shun, With cautious fears oppress'd I thus begun:</p><p>"'O friends! O ever exorcised in care! Hear Heaven's commands, and reverence what ye hear! To fly these shores the prescient Theban shade And Circe warn! Oh be their voice obey'd Some mighty woe relentless Heaven forebodes: Fly these dire regions, and revere the gods!'</p></div> </div>
