With rapid step the goddess urged her way; There every eye with slumberous chains she bound, And dash'd the flowing goblet to the ground. Drowsy they rose, with heavy fumes oppress'd, Reel'd from the palace, and retired to rest. Then thus, in Mentor's reverend form array'd, Spoke to Telemachus the martial maid. "Lo! on the seas, prepared the vessel stands, The impatient mariner thy speed demands." Swift as she spoke, with rapid pace she leads; The footsteps of the deity he treads. Swift to the shore they move along the strand; The ready vessel rides, the sailors ready stand.</p></div> </div>
