<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What length of time must we consume in vain, Too curious to explore the menial train! While the proud foes, industrious to destroy Thy wealth, in riot the delay enjoy. Suffice it in this exigence alone To mark the damsels that attend the throne: Dispersed the youth reside; their faith to prove Jove grants henceforth, if thou hast spoke from Jove."</p><p>While in debate they waste the hours away, The associates of the prince repass'd the bay: With speed they guide the vessel to the shores; With speed debarking land the naval stores: Then, faithful to their charge, to Clytius bear, And trust the presents to his friendly care. Swift to the queen a herald flies to impart Her son's return, and ease a parent's heart: Lest a sad prey to ever-musing cares, Pale grief destroy what time awhile forbears.</p></div> </div>
