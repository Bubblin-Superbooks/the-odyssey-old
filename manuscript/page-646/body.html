(Returns Antinous with retorted eye) Objects uncouth, to check the genial joy. Enough of these our court already grace; Of giant stomach, and of famish'd face. Such guests Eumaeus to his country brings, To share our feast, and lead the life of kings."</p><p>To whom the hospitable swain rejoins: "Thy passion, prince, belies thy knowing mind. Who calls, from distant nations to his own, The poor, distinguish'd by their wants alone? Round the wide world are sought those men divine Who public structures raise, or who design; Those to whose eyes the gods their ways reveal, Or bless with salutary arts to heal; But chief to poets such respect belongs, By rival nations courted for their songs; These states invite, and mighty kings admire, Wide as the sun displays his vital fire.</p></div> </div>
