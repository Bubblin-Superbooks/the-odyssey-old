Their prize escaped the faithless pirates mourn'd; But deem'd inquiry vain, and to their ships return'd. Screen'd by protecting gods from hostile eyes, They led me to a good man and a wise, To live beneath thy hospitable care, And wait the woes Heaven dooms me yet to bear."</p><p>"Unhappy guest! whose sorrows touch my mind! (Thus good Eumaeus with a sigh rejoin'd,) For real sufferings since I grieve sincere, Check not with fallacies the springing tear: Nor turn the passion into groundless joy For him whom Heaven has destined to destroy.</p></div> </div>
