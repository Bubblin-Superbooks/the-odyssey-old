Two sewers from day to day the revels wait, Exact of taste, and serve the feast in state. With such a foe the unequal fight to try, Were by false courage unrevenged to die. Then what assistant powers you boast relate, Ere yet we mingle in the stern debate."</p><p>"Mark well my voice, (Ulysses straight replies:) What need of aids, if favour'd by the skies? If shielded to the dreadful fight we move, By mighty Pallas, and by thundering Jove?"</p></div> </div>
