What sounds are these that gather from he shores? The voice of nymphs that haunt the sylvan bowers, The fair-hair'd Dryads of the shady wood; Or azure daughters of the silver flood; Or human voice? but issuing from the shades, Why cease I straight to learn what sound invades?"</p><p>Then, where the grove with leaves umbrageous bends, With forceful strength a branch the hero rends; Around his loins the verdant cincture spreads A wreathy foliage and concealing shades. As when a lion in the midnight hours, Beat by rude blasts, and wet with wintry showers, Descends terrific from the mountains brow; With living flames his rolling eye balls glow;</p></div> </div>
