The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame; and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.</p><p>"There is some truth, though some malicious exaggeration, in the lines of Pope:--</p><p>"'The critic eye--that microscope of wit-- Sees hairs and pores, examines bit by bit; How parts relate to parts, or they to whole. The body's harmony, the beaming soul, Are things which Kuster, Burmann, Wasse, shall see, When man's whole frame is obvious to a flea.'"</p></div> </div>
