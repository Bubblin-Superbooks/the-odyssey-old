<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Wrapp'd in the embrace of sleep, the faithful train O'er seas convey'd me to my native reign: Embroider'd vestures, gold, and brass, are laid Conceal'd in caverns in the sylvan shade. Hither, intent the rival rout to slay, And plan the scene of death, I bend my way; So Pallas wills--but thou, my son, explain The names and numbers of the audacious train; 'Tis mine to judge if better to employ Assistant force, or singly to destroy."</p><p>"O'er earth (returns the prince) resounds thy name, Thy well-tried wisdom, and thy martial fame, Yet at thy words I start, in wonder lost; Can we engage, not decades but an host? Can we alone in furious battle stand, Against that numerous and determined band? Hear then their numbers; from Dulichium came Twice twenty-six, all peers of mighty name.</p></div> </div>
