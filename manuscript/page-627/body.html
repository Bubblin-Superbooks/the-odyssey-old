The prince with transport flew, Hung round his neck, while tears his cheek bedew; Nor less the father pour'd a social flood; They wept abundant, and they wept aloud. As the bold eagle with fierce sorrow stung, Or parent vulture, mourns her ravish'd young; They cry, they scream, their unfledged brood a prey To some rude churl, and borne by stealth away: So they aloud: and tears in tides had run, Their grief unfinish'd with the setting sun; But checking the full torrent in its flow, The prince thus interrupts the solemn woe. "What ship transported thee, O father, say; And what bless'd hands have oar'd thee on the way?"</p><p>"All, all (Ulysses instant made reply), I tell thee all, my child, my only joy! Phaeacians bore me to the port assign'd, A nation ever to the stranger kind;</p></div> </div>
