<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The king precedes; a bowl with fragrant wine (Libation destined to the powers divine) His right hand held: before the steed he stands, Then, mix'd with prayers, he utters these commands:</p><p>"Farewell, and prosper, youths! let Nestor know What grateful thoughts still in this bosom glow, For all the proofs of his paternal care, Through the long dangers of the ten years' war." "Ah! doubt not our report (the prince rejoin'd) Of all the virtues of thy generous mind. And oh! return'd might we Ulysses meet! To him thy presents show, thy words repeat: How will each speech his grateful wonder raise! How will each gift indulge us in thy praise!"</p></div> </div>
