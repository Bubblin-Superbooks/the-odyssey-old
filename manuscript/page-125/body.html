<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores To shake with war proud Ilion's lofty towers, Deeds then undone me faithful tongue foretold: Heaven seal'd my words, and you those deeds behold. I see (I cried) his woes, a countless train; I see his friends o'erwhelm'd beneath the main; How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams: Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes!"</p><p>To whom Eurymachus--"Fly, dotard fly, With thy wise dreams, and fables of the sky. Go prophesy at home, thy sons advise: Here thou art sage in vain--I better read the skies Unnumber'd birds glide through the aerial way; Vagrants of air, and unforeboding stray. Cold in the tomb, or in the deeps below, Ulysses lies; oh wert thou laid as low!</p></div> </div>
