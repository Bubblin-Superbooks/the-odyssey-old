<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"O prince, in early youth divinely wise, Born, the Ulysses of thy age to rise If to the son the father's worth descends, O'er the wide wave success thy ways attends To tread the walks of death he stood prepared; And what he greatly thought, he nobly dared. Were not wise sons descendant of the wise, And did not heroes from brave heroes rise, Vain were my hopes: few sons attain the praise Of their great sires, and most their sires disgrace. But since thy veins paternal virtue fires, And all Penelope thy soul inspires, Go, and succeed: the rivals' aims despise; For never, never wicked man was wise. Blind they rejoice, though now, ev'n now they fall; Death hastes amain: one hour o'erwhelms them all! And lo, with speed we plough the watery way; My power shall guard thee, and my hand convey: The winged vessel studious I prepare, Through seas and realms companion of thy care.</p></div> </div>
