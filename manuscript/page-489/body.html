<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"There wandering through the gloom I first survey'd, New to the realms of death, Elpenor's shade: His cold remains all naked to the sky On distant shores unwept, unburied lie. Sad at the sight I stand, deep fix'd in woe, And ere I spoke the tears began to flow.</p><p>"'O say what angry power Elpenor led To glide in shades, and wander with the dead? How could thy soul, by realms and seas disjoin'd, Outfly the nimble sail, and leave the lagging wind?</p><p>"The ghost replied: 'To hell my doom I owe, Demons accursed, dire ministers of woe! My feet, through wine unfaithful to their weight, Betray'd me tumbling from a towery height: Staggering I reel'd, and as I reel'd I fell, Lux'd the neck-joint--my soul descends to hell.</p></div> </div>
