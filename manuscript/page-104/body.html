His virgin-sword AEgysthus' veins imbrued; The murderer fell, and blood atoned for blood. O greatly bless'd with every blooming grace! With equal steps the paths of glory trace; Join to that royal youth's your rival name, And shine eternal in the sphere of fame. But my associates now my stay deplore, Impatient on the hoarse-resounding shore. Thou, heedful of advice, secure proceed; My praise the precept is, be thine the deed.</p><p>"The counsel of my friend (the youth rejoin'd) Imprints conviction on my grateful mind. So fathers speak (persuasive speech and mild) Their sage experience to the favourite child. But, since to part, for sweet refection due, The genial viands let my train renew; And the rich pledge of plighted faith receive, Worthy the air of Ithaca to give."</p></div> </div>
