Your patrimonial stores in peace possess; Undoubted, all your filial claim confess: Your private right should impious power invade, The peers of Ithaca would arm in aid. But say, that stranger guest who late withdrew, What and from whence? his name and lineage shew. His grave demeanour and majestic grace Speak him descended of non vulgar race: Did he some loan of ancient right require, Or came forerunner of your sceptr'd sire?"</p><p>"Oh son of Polybus!" the prince replies, "No more my sire will glad these longing eyes; The queen's fond hope inventive rumour cheers, Or vain diviners' dreams divert her fears. That stranger-guest the Taphian realm obeys, A realm defended with encircling seas. Mentes, an ever-honour'd name, of old High in Ulysses' social list enroll'd."</p></div> </div>
