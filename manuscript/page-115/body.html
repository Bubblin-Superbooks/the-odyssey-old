<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> With decent grief the royal dead deplored, For the chaste queen select an equal lord. Then let revenge your daring mind employ, By fraud or force the suitor train destroy, And starting into manhood, scorn the boy. Hast thou not heard how young Orestes, fired With great revenge, immortal praise acquired? His virgin-sword AEgysthus' veins imbrued; The murderer fell, and blood atoned for blood. O greatly bless'd with every blooming grace! With equal steps the paths of glory trace; Join to that royal youth's your rival name, And shine eternal in the sphere of fame. But my associates now my stay deplore, Impatient on the hoarse-resounding shore. Thou, heedful of advice, secure proceed; My praise the precept is, be thine the deed.</p><p>"The counsel of my friend (the youth rejoin'd) Imprints conviction on my grateful mind.</p></div> </div>
