Then Heaven decrees, in peace to end my days And steal myself from life by slow decays! Unknown to pain, in age resign my breath, When late stern Neptune points the shaft of death; To the dark grave retiring as to rest; My people blessing, by my people bless'd. Such future scenes the all-righteous powers display By their dread seer, and such my future day."</p><p>To whom thus firm of</p></div> </div>
