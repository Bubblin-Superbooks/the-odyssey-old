<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pallas, to these, deplores the unequal fates Of wise Ulysses and his toils relates: Her hero's danger touch'd the pitying power, The nymph's seducements, and the magic bower. Thus she began her plaint: "Immortal Jove! And you who fill the blissful seats above! Let kings no more with gentle mercy sway, Or bless a people willing to obey, But crush the nations with an iron rod, And every monarch be the scourge of God. If from your thoughts Ulysses you remove, Who ruled his subjects with a father's love, Sole in an isle, encircled by the main, Abandon'd, banish'd from his native reign, Unbless'd he sighs, detained by lawless charms, And press'd unwilling in Calypso's arms. Nor friends are there, nor vessels to convey, Nor oars to cut the immeasurable way.</p></div> </div>
