His sacred eloquence in balm distils, And the soothed heart with secret pleasure fills. Three days have spent their beams, three nights have run Their silent journey, since his tale begun, Unfinish'd yet; and yet I thirst to hear! As when some heaven-taught poet charms the ear (Suspending sorrow with celestial strain Breathed from the gods to soften human pain) Time steals away with unregarded wing, And the soul hears him, though he cease to sing</p><p>"Ulysses late he saw, on Cretan ground (His fathers guest), for Minos' birth renown'd. He now but waits the wind to waft him o'er, With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia's shore."</p></div> </div>
