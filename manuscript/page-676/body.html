For where's an arm, like thine, Ulysses! strong, To curb wild riot, and to punish wrong?"</p><p>She spoke. Telemachus then sneezed aloud; Constrain'd, his nostril echoed through the crowd. The smiling queen the happy omen bless'd:</p><p>"So may these impious fall, by Fate oppress'd!" Then to Eumaeus: "Bring the stranger, fly! And if my questions meet a true reply, Graced with a decent robe he shall retire, A gift in season which his wants require."</p></div> </div>
