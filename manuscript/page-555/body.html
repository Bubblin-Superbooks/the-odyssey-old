<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That name for ever dread, yet ever dear, E'en in his absence I pronounce with fear: In my respect, he bears a prince's part; But lives a very brother in my heart."</p><p>Thus spoke the faithful swain, and thus rejoin'd The master of his grief, the man of patient mind: "Ulysses, friend! shall view his old abodes (Distrustful as thou art), nor doubt the gods. Nor speak I rashly, but with faith averr'd, And what I speak attesting Heaven has heard. If so, a cloak and vesture be my meed: Till his return no title shall I plead, Though certain be my news, and great my need. Whom want itself can force untruths to tell, My soul detests him as the gates of hell.</p></div> </div>
