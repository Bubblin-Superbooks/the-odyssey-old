<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Chiefs of renown! loud-echoing shrieks arise; I turn, and view them quivering in the skies; They call, and aid with outstretch'd arms implore; In vain they call! those arms are stretch'd no more. As from some rock that overhangs the flood The silent fisher casts the insidious food, With fraudful care he waits the finny prize, And sudden lifts it quivering to the skies: So the foul monster lifts her prey on high, So pant the wretches struggling in the sky; In the wide dungeon she devours her food, And the flesh trembles while she churns the blood. Worn as I am with griefs, with care decay'd, Never, I never scene so dire survey'd! My shivering blood, congeal'd, forgot to flow; Aghast I stood, a monument of woe!</p><p>"Now from the rocks the rapid vessel flies, And the hoarse din like distant thunder dies; To Sol's bright isle</p></div> </div>
