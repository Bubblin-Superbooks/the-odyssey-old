<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now came the night, and darkness cover'd o'er The face of things; the winds began to roar; The driving storm the watery west-wind pours, And Jove descends in deluges of showers. Studious of rest and warmth, Ulysses lies, Foreseeing from the first the storm would rise In mere necessity of coat and cloak, With artful preface to his host he spoke: "Hear me, my friends! who this good banquet grace; 'Tis sweet to play the fool in time and place, And wine can of their wits the wise beguile, Make the sage frolic, and the serious smile, The grave in merry measures frisk about, And many a long-repented word bring out. Since to be talkative I now commence, Let wit cast off the sullen yoke of sense. Once I was strong (would Heaven restore those days!) And with my betters claim'd a share of praise.</p></div> </div>
