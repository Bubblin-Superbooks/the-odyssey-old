<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Nine ships I mann'd, equipp'd with ready stores, Intent to voyage to the Aegyptian shores; In feast and sacrifice my chosen train Six days consum'd; the seventh we plough'd the main. Crete's ample fields diminish to our eye; Before the Boreal blast the vessels fly; Safe through the level seas we sweep our way; The steersman governs, and the ships obey. The fifth fair morn we stem the Aegyptian tide, And tilting o'er the bay the vessels ride: To anchor there my fellows I command, And spies commission to explore the land. But, sway'd by lust of gain, and headlong will, The coasts they ravage, and the natives kill. The spreading clamour to their city flies, And horse and foot in mingled tumult rise. The reddening dawn reveals the circling fields, Horrid with bristly spears, and glancing shields. Jove thunder'd on their side.</p></div> </div>
