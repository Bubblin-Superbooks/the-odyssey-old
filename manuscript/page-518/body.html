<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> To me? whose wit exceeds the powers divine, No less than mortals are surpass'd by thine. Know'st thou not me; who made thy life my care, Through ten years' wandering, and through ten years' war; Who taught thee arts, Alcinous to persuade, To raise his wonder, and engage his aid; And now appear, thy treasures to protect, Conceal thy person, thy designs direct, And tell what more thou must from Fate expect; Domestic woes far heavier to be borne! The pride of fools, and slaves' insulting scorn? But thou be silent, nor reveal thy state; Yield to the force of unresisted Fate, And bear unmoved the wrongs of base mankind, The last, and hardest, conquest of the mind."</p><p>"Goddess of wisdom! (Ithacus replies,) He who discerns thee must be truly wise, So seldom view'd and ever in disguise! When the bold Argives led their warring powers, Against proud Ilion's well-defended towers, Ulysses was thy care, celestial maid! Graced with thy sight, and favoured with thy aid.</p></div> </div>
