<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> O woman, woman, when to ill thy mind Is bent, all hell contains no fouler fiend: And such was mine! who basely plunged her sword Through the fond bosom where she reign'd adored! Alas! I hoped the toils of war o'ercome, To meet soft quiet and repose at home; Delusive hope! O wife, thy deeds disgrace The perjured sex, and blacken all the race; And should posterity one virtuous find, Name Clytemnestra, they will curse the kind.'</p><p>"Oh injured shade (I cried) what mighty woes To thy imperial race from woman rose! By woman here thou tread'st this mournful strand, And Greece by woman lies a desert land.'</p><p>"'Warn'd by my ills beware, (the shade replies,) Nor trust the sex that is so rarely wise; When earnest to explore thy secret breast, Unfold some trifle, but conceal the rest.</p></div> </div>
