<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Neleus his treasures one long year detains, As long he groan'd in Philacus' chains: Meantime, what anguish and what rage combined For lovely Pero rack'd his labouring mind! Yet 'scaped he death; and vengeful of his wrong To Pylos drove the lowing herds along: Then (Neleus vanquish'd, and consign'd the fair To Bias' arms) he so sought a foreign air; Argos the rich for his retreat he chose, There form'd his empire; there his palace rose. From him Antiphates and Mantius came: The first begot Oicleus great in fame, And he Amphiaraus, immortal name! The people's saviour, and divinely wise, Beloved by Jove, and him who gilds the skies; Yet short his date of life! by female pride he dies.</p></div> </div>
