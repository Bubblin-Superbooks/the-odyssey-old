Nymphs of this fountain! to whose sacred names Our rural victims mount in blazing flames! To whom Ulysses' piety preferr'd The yearly firstlings of his flock and herd; Succeed my wish, your votary restore: Oh, be some god his convoy to our shore! Due pains shall punish then this slave's offence, And humble all his airs of insolence, Who, proudly stalking, leaves the herds at large, Commences courtier, and neglects his charge."</p><p>"What mutters he? (Melanthius sharp rejoins;) This crafty miscreant, big with dark designs? The day shall come--nay, 'tis already near-- When, slave! to sell thee at a price too dear Must be my care; and hence transport thee o'er, A load and scandal to this happy shore.</p></div> </div>
