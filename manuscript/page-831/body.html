To insult the dead is cruel and unjust; Fate and their crime have sunk them to the dust. Nor heeded these the censure of mankind, The good and bad were equal in their mind Justly the price of worthlessness they paid, And each now wails an unlamented shade. But thou sincere! O Euryclea, say, What maids dishonour us, and what obey?"</p><p>Then she: "In these thy kingly walls remain (My son) full fifty of the handmaid train, Taught by my care to cull the fleece or weave, And servitude with pleasing tasks deceive; Of these, twice six pursue their wicked way, Nor me, nor chaste Penelope obey; Nor fits it that Telemachus command (Young as he is) his mother's female band.</p></div> </div>
