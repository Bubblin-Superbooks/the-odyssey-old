Beneath thy palace-roof forget thy care; Bless'd in thy queen! bless'd in thy blooming heir! Whom, to the gods when suppliant fathers bow They name the standard of their dearest vow."</p><p>"Just is thy kind reproach (the chief rejoin'd), Deeds full of fate distract my various mind, In contemplation wrapp'd. This hostile crew What single arm hath prowess to subdue? Or if, by Jove's and thy auxiliar aid, They're doom'd to bleed; O say, celestial maid! Where shall Ulysses shun, or how sustain Nations embattled to revenge the slain?"</p><p>"Oh impotence of faith! (Minerva cries,) If man on frail unknowing man relies, Doubt you the gods? Lo, Pallas' self descends, Inspires thy counsels, and thy toils attends.</p></div> </div>
