<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Arrived, advance, impatient of delay, And to the lofty palace bend thy way: The lofty palace overlooks the town, From every dome by pomp superior known; A child may point the way. With earnest gait Seek thou the queen along the rooms of state; Her royal hand a wondrous work designs, Around a circle of bright damsels shines; Part twist the threads, and part the wool dispose, While with the purple orb the spindle glows. High on a throne, amid the Scherian powers, My royal father shares the genial hours: But to the queen thy mournful tale disclose, With the prevailing eloquence of woes: So shalt thou view with joy thy natal shore, Though mountains rise between and oceans roar."</p><p>She added not, but waving, as she wheel'd, The silver scourge, it glitter'd o'er the field;</p></div> </div>
