<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thus then I judge: while yet the planks sustain The wild waves' fury, here I fix'd remain: But, when their texture to the tempest yields, I launch adventurous on the liquid fields, Join to the help of gods the strength of man, And take this method, since the best I can."</p><p>While thus his thoughts an anxious council hold, The raging god a watery mountain roll'd; Like a black sheet the whelming billows spread, Burst o'er the float, and thunder'd on his head. Planks, beams, disparted fly; the scatter'd wood Rolls diverse, and in fragments strews the flood. So the rude Boreas, o'er the field new-shorn, Tosses and drives the scatter'd heaps of corn.</p></div> </div>
