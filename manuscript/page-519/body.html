<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But in thy consort cease to fear a foe, For thee she feels sincerity of woe; When Troy first bled beneath the Grecian arms, She shone unrivall'd with a blaze of charms; Thy infant son her fragrant bosom press'd, Hung at her knee, or wanton'd at her breast; But now the years a numerous train have ran; The blooming boy is ripen'd into man; Thy eyes shall see him burn with noble fire, The sire shall bless his son, the son his sire; But my Orestes never met these eyes, Without one look the murder'd father dies; Then from a wretched friend this wisdom learn, E'en to thy queen disguised, unknown, return; For since of womankind so few are just, Think all are false, nor e'en the faithful trust.</p><p>"'But, say, resides my son in royal port, In rich Orchomenos, or Sparta's court? Or say in Pyle?</p></div> </div>
