<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus serious they; but he who gilds the skies, The gay Apollo, thus to Hermes cries: "Wouldst thou enchain'd like Mars, O Hermes, lie And bear the shame like Mars to share the joy?"</p><p>"O envied shame! (the smiling youth rejoin'd;) And thrice the chains, and thrice more firmly bind; Gaze all ye gods, and every goddess gaze, Yet eager would I bless the sweet disgrace."</p><p>Loud laugh the rest, e'en Neptune laughs aloud, Yet sues importunate to loose the god. "And free, (he cries) O Vulcan! free from shame Thy captives; I ensure the penal claim."</p><p>"Will Neptune (Vulcan then) the faithless trust? He suffers who gives surety for the unjust: But say, if that lewd scandal of the sky, To liberty restored, perfidious fly: Say, wilt thou bear the mulct?" He instant cries, "The mulct I bear, if Mars perfidious flies."</p></div> </div>
