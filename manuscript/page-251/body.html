These, if the gods with my desire comply (The gods, alas, more mighty far than I, And better skill'd in dark events to come), In peace shall land thee at thy native home."</p><p>With sighs Ulysses heard the words she spoke, Then thus his melancholy silence broke: "Some other motive, goddess! sways thy mind (Some close design, or turn of womankind), Nor my return the end, nor this the way, On a slight raft to pass the swelling sea, Huge, horrid, vast! where scarce in safety sails The best-built ship, though Jove inspires the gales. The bold proposal how shall I fulfil, Dark as I am, unconscious of thy will? Swear, then, thou mean'st not what my soul forebodes; Swear by the solemn oath that binds the gods."</p></div> </div>
