<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Up sprung a brisker breeze; with freshening gales The friendly goddess stretch'd the swelling sails; We drop our oars; at ease the pilot guides; The vessel light along the level glides. When, rising sad and slow, with pensive look, Thus to the melancholy train I spoke:</p><p>"'O friends, oh ever partners of my woes, Attend while I what Heaven foredooms disclose. Hear all! Fate hangs o'er all; on you it lies To live or perish! to be safe, be wise!</p><p>"'In flowery meads the sportive Sirens play, Touch the soft lyre, and tune the vocal lay; Me, me alone, with fetters firmly bound, The gods allow to hear the dangerous sound. Hear and obey; if freedom I demand, Be every fetter strain'd, be added band to band.'</p></div> </div>
