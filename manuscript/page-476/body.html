Around their lord my sad companions mourn, Each breast beats homeward, anxious to return: If but a moment parted from thy eyes, Their tears flow round me, and my heart complies.'</p><p>"'Go then (she cried), ah go! yet think, not I, Not Circe, but the Fates, your wish deny. Ah, hope not yet to breathe thy native air! Far other journey first demands thy care; To tread the uncomfortable paths beneath, And view the realms of darkness and of death. There seek the Theban bard, deprived of sight; Within, irradiate with prophetic light; To whom Persephone, entire and whole, Gave to retain the unseparated soul: The rest are forms, of empty ether made; Impassive semblance, and a flitting shade.'</p></div> </div>
