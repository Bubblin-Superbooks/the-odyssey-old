<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Retire we instant to our native reign, Nor be the wealth of kings consumed in vain; Then wed whom choice approves: the queen be given To some blest prince, the prince decreed by Heaven."</p><p>Abash'd, the suitor train his voice attends; Till from his throne Amphinomus ascends, Who o'er Dulichium stretch'd his spacious reign, A land of plenty, bless'd with every grain: Chief of the numbers who the queen address'd, And though displeasing, yet displeasing least. Soft were his words; his actions wisdom sway'd; Graceful awhile he paused, then mildly said:</p><p>"O friends, forbear! and be the thought withstood: 'Tis horrible to shed imperial blood! Consult we first the all-seeing powers above, And the sure oracles of righteous Jove. If they assent, e'en by this hand he dies; If they forbid, I war not with the skies."</p></div> </div>
