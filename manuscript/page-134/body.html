And now they ship their oars, and crown with wine The holy goblet to the powers divine: Imploring all the gods that reign above, But chief the blue-eyed progeny of Jove.</p><p>Thus all the night they stem the liquid way, And end their voyage with the morning ray.</p><p>BOOK III</p><p>ARGUMENT</p><p>THE INTERVIEW OF TELEMACHUS AND NESTOR.</p><p>Telemachus, guided by Pallas in the shape of Mentor, arrives in the morning at Pylos, where Nestor and his sons are sacrificing on the sea-shore to Neptune. Telemachus declares the occasion of his coming: and Nestor relates what passed in their return from Troy, how their fleets were separated, and he never since heard of Ulysses.</p></div> </div>
