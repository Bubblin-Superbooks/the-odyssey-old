<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The wandering chief with toils on toils oppress'd, Leucothea saw, and pity touch'd her breast. (Herself a mortal once, of Cadmus' strain, But now an azure sister of the main) Swift as a sea-mew springing from the flood, All radiant on the raft the goddess stood; Then thus address'd him: "Thou whom heaven decrees To Neptune's wrath, stern tyrant of the seas! (Unequal contest!) not his rage and power, Great as he is, such virtue shall devour. What I suggest, thy wisdom will perform: Forsake thy float, and leave it to the storm; Strip off thy garments; Neptune's fury brave With naked strength, and plunge into the wave. To reach Phaeacia all thy nerves extend, There Fate decrees thy miseries shall end.</p></div> </div>
