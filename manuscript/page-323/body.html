<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Now on return her care Nausicaa bends, The robes resumes, the glittering car ascends, Far blooming o'er the field; and as she press'd The splendid seat, the listening chief address'd:</p><p>"Stranger, arise! the sun rolls down the day. Lo, to the palace I direct thy way; Where, in high state, the nobles of the land Attend my royal sire, a radiant band But hear, though wisdom in thy soul presides, Speaks from thy tongue, and every action guides; Advance at distance, while I pass the plain Where o'er the furrows waves the golden grain; Alone I reascend--With airy mounds A strength of wall the guarded city bounds; The jutting land two ample bays divides: Full through the narrow mouths descend the tides; The spacious basons arching rocks enclose, A sure defence from every storm that blows.</p></div> </div>
