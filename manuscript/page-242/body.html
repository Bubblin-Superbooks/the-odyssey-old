<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then bids prepare the hospitable treat: Vain shows of love to veil his felon hate! To grace the victor's welcome from the wars, A train of coursers and triumphal cars Magnificent he leads: the royal guest, Thoughtless of ill, accepts the fraudful feast. The troop forth-issuing from the dark recess, With homicidal rage the king oppress! So, whilst he feeds luxurious in the stall, The sovereign of the herd is doomed to fall, The partners of his fame and toils at Troy, Around their lord, a mighty ruin, lie: Mix'd with the brave, the base invaders bleed; Aegysthus sole survives to boast the deed."</p><p>He said: chill horrors shook my shivering soul, Rack'd wish convulsive pangs in dust I roll; And hate, in madness of extreme despair, To view the sun, or breathe the vital air.</p></div> </div>
