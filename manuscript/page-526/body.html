<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Full fifty pregnant females each contain'd; The males without (a smaller race) remain'd; Doom'd to supply the suitors' wasteful feast, A stock by daily luxury decreased; Now scarce four hundred left. These to defend, Four savage dogs, a watchful guard, attend. Here sat Eumaeus, and his cares applied To form strong buskins of well-season'd hide. Of four assistants who his labour share, Three now were absent on the rural care; The fourth drove victims to a suitor train: But he, of ancient faith, a simple swain, Sigh'd, while he furnish'd the luxurious board, And wearied Heaven with wishes for his lord.</p><p>Soon as Ulysses near the inclosure drew, With open mouths the furious mastiffs flew: Down sat the sage, and cautious to withstand, Let fall the offensive truncheon from his hand.</p></div> </div>
