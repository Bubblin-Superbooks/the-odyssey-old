<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Expert in every art, I boast the skill To give the feather'd arrow wings to kill; Should a whole host at once discharge the bow, My well-aim'd shaft with death prevents the foe: Alone superior in the field of Troy, Great Philoctetes taught the shaft to fly. From all the sons of earth unrivall'd praise I justly claim; but yield to better days, To those famed days when great Alcides rose, And Eurytus, who bade the gods be foes (Vain Eurytus, whose art became his crime, Swept from the earth, he perish'd in his prime: Sudden the irremeable way he trod, Who boldly durst defy the bowyer god). In fighting fields as far the spear I throw As flies an arrow from the well-drawn bow. Sole in the race the contest I decline, Stiff are my weary joints, and I resign; By storms and hunger worn; age well may fail, When storms and hunger doth at once assail."</p></div> </div>
