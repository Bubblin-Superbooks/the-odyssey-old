<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> First came the son; the father nest succeeds, Clad like a beggar, whom Eumaeus leads; Propp'd on a staff, deform'd with age and care, And hung with rags that flutter'd in the air. Who could Ulysses in that form behold? Scorn'd by the young, forgotten by the old, Ill-used by all! to every wrong resigned, Patient he suffered with a constant mind.</p></div> </div>
