A vest and tunic o'er me next she threw, Fresh from the bath, and dropping balmy dew; Then led and placed me on the sovereign seat, With carpets spread; a footstool at my feet. The golden ewer a nymph obsequious brings, Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs; With copious water the bright vase supplies A silver laver of capacious size. I wash'd.</p></div> </div>
