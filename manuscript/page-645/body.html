<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus he: nor aught Telemachus replied, But left the mansion with a lofty stride: Schemes of revenge his pondering breast elate, Revolving deep the suitors' sudden fate, Arriving now before the imperial hall, He props his spear against the pillar'd wall; Then like a lion o'er the threshold bounds; The marble pavement with his steps resounds: His eye first glanced where Euryclea spreads With furry spoils of beasts the splendid beds: She saw, she wept, she ran with eager pace, And reach'd her master with a long embrace. All crowded round, the family appears With wild entrancement, and ecstatic tears. Swift from above descends the royal fair (Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air); Hangs o'er her son, in his embraces dies; Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes: Few words she spoke, though much she had to say; And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way.</p></div> </div>
