The rest retreat: the victors now advance, Each from the dead resumes his bloody lance. Again the foe discharge the steely shower; Again made frustrate by the virgin-power. Some, turn'd by Pallas, on the threshold fall, Some wound the gate, some ring against the wall; Some weak, or ponderous with the brazen head, Drop harmless on the pavement, sounding dead.</p><p>Then bold Amphimedon his javelin cast: Thy hand, Telemachus, it lightly razed: And from Ctesippus' arm the spear elanced: On good Eumaeus' shield and shoulder glanced; Not lessened of their force (so light the wound) Each sung along and dropped upon the ground.</p></div> </div>
