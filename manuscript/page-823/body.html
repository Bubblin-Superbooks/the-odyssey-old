By the bold son Amphimedon was slain, And Polybus renown'd, the faithful swain. Pierced through the breast the rude Ctesippus bled, And thus Philaetius gloried o'er the dead:</p><p>"There end thy pompous vaunts and high disdain; O sharp in scandal, voluble and vain! How weak is mortal pride! To Heaven alone The event of actions and our fates are known: Scoffer, behold what gratitude we bear: The victim's heel is answered with this spear."</p><p>Ulysses brandish'd high his vengeful steel, And Damastorides that instant fell: Fast by Leocritus expiring lay, The prince's javelin tore its bloody way Through all his bowels: down he tumbled prone, His batter'd front and brains besmear the stone.</p></div> </div>
