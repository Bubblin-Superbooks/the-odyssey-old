With power congenial join'd, propitious aid The chief adopted by the martial maid! Such to our wish the warrior soon restore, As when, contending on the Lesbian shore, His prowess Philomelides confess'd, And loud acclaiming Greeks the victor bless'd: Then soon the invaders of his bed, and throne, Their love presumptuous shall by death atone. Now what you question of my ancient friend, With truth I answer; thou the truth attend.</p></div> </div>
