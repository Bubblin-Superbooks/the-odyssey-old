Minerva viewless on her charge attends, And with her golden lamp his toil befriends. Not such the sickly beams, which unsincere Gild the gross vapour of this nether sphere! A present deity the prince confess'd, And wrapp'd with ecstasy the sire address'd:</p><p>"What miracle thus dazzles with surprise! Distinct in rows the radiant columns rise; The walls, where'er my wondering sight I turn, And roofs, amidst a blaze of glory burn! Some visitant of pure ethereal race With his bright presence deigns the dome to grace."</p></div> </div>
