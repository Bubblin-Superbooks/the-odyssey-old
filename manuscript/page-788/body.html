<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The ready swains obey'd with joyful haste, Behind the felon unperceived they pass'd, As round the room in quest of arms he goes (The half-shut door conceal'd his lurking foes): One hand sustain'd a helm, and one the shield Which old Laertes wont in youth to wield, Cover'd with dust, with dryness chapp'd and worn, The brass corroded, and the leather torn. Thus laden, o'er the threshold as he stepp'd, Fierce on the villain from each side they leap'd, Back by the hair the trembling dastard drew, And down reluctant on the pavement threw. Active and pleased the zealous swains fulfil At every point their master's rigid will; First, fast behind, his hands and feet they bound, Then straighten'd cords involved his body round; So drawn aloft, athwart the column tied, The howling felon swung from side to side.</p></div> </div>
