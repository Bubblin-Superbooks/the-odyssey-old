<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The monarch's son a shipwreck'd wretch relieved, The sire with hospitable rites received, And in his palace like a brother placed, With gifts of price and gorgeous garments graced While here I sojourn'd, oft I heard the fame How late Ulysses to the country came. How loved, how honour'd in this court he stay'd, And here his whole collected treasure laid; I saw myself the vast unnumber'd store Of steel elaborate, and refulgent ore, And brass high heap'd amidst the regal dome; Immense supplies for ages yet to come! Meantime he voyaged to explore the will Of Jove, on high Dodona's holy hill, What means might best his safe return avail, To come in pomp, or bear a secret sail? Full oft has Phidon, whilst he pour'd the wine, Attesting solemn all the powers divine, That soon Ulysses would return, declared The sailors waiting, and the ships prepared.</p></div> </div>
