Straight to the queen and palace shall I fly, Or yet more distant, to some lord apply?"</p><p>The prince return'd: "Renown'd in days of yore Has stood our father's hospitable door; No other roof a stranger should receive, No other hands than ours the welcome give. But in my absence riot fills the place, Nor bears the modest queen a stranger's face; From noiseful revel far remote she flies, But rarely seen, or seen with weeping eyes. No--let Eurymachus receive my guest, Of nature courteous, and by far the best; He woos the queen with more respectful flame, And emulates her former husband's fame, With what success, 'tis Jove's alone to know, And the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe."</p></div> </div>
