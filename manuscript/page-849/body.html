Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place? Or, if a merchant in pursuit of gain, What port received thy vessel from the main? Or comest thou single, or attend thy train?"</p><p>Then thus the son: "From Alybas I came, My palace there; Eperitus my name Not vulgar born: from Aphidas, the king Of Polyphemon's royal line, I spring. Some adverse demon from Sicania bore Our wandering course, and drove us on your shore; Far from the town, an unfrequented bay Relieved our wearied vessel from the sea. Five years have circled since these eyes pursued Ulysses parting through the sable flood: Prosperous he sail'd, with dexter auguries, And all the wing'd good omens of the skies. Well hoped we then to meet on this fair shore, Whom Heaven, alas! decreed to meet no more."</p></div> </div>
