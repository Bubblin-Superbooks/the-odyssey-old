The radiant helmet from my brows unlaced, And low on earth my shield and javelin cast, I meet the monarch with a suppliant's face, Approach his chariot, and his knees embrace, He heard, he saved, he placed me at his side; My state he pitied, and my tears he dried, Restrain'd the rage the vengeful foe express'd, And turn'd the deadly weapons from my breast. Pious! to guard the hospitable rite, And fearing Jove, whom mercy's works delight.</p><p>"In Aegypt thus with peace and plenty bless'd, I lived (and happy still have lived) a guest. On seven bright years successive blessings wait; The next changed all the colour of my fate.</p></div> </div>
