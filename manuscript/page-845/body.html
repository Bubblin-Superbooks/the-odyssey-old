<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> If one man's blood, though mean, distain our hands, The homicide retreats to foreign lands; By us, in heaps the illustrious peerage falls, The important deed our whole attention calls."</p><p>"Be that thy care (Telemachus replies) The world conspires to speak Ulysses wise; For wisdom all is thine! lo, I obey, And dauntless follow where you led the way; Nor shalt thou in the day of danger find Thy coward son degenerate lag behind."</p><p>"Then instant to the bath (the monarch cries), Bid the gay youth and sprightly virgins rise, Thence all descend in pomp and proud array, And bid the dome resound the mirthful lay; While the sweet lyrist airs of rapture sings, And forms the dance responsive to the strings, That hence the eluded passengers may say, 'Lo! the queen weds! we hear the spousal lay!' The suitor's death, unknown, till we remove Far from the court, and act inspired by Jove."</p></div> </div>
