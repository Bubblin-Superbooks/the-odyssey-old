Thy ancient friend, O stranger, is no more! Full recompense thy bounty else had borne: For every good man yields a just return: So civil rights demand; and who begins The track of friendship, not pursuing, sins. But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess'd, What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest? That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone! Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son! If ever man to misery was born, 'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn! Far from his friends, and from his native reign, He lies a prey to monsters of the main; Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear, Or screaming vultures scatter through the air: Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed;</p></div> </div>
