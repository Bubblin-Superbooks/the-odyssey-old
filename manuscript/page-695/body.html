<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Twice ten sad years o'er earth and ocean toss'd, 'Tis given at length to view my native coast. Pallas, unconquer'd maid, my frame surrounds With grace divine: her power admits no bounds; She o'er my limbs old age and wrinkles shed; Now strong as youth, magnificent I tread. The gods with ease frail man depress or raise, Exalt the lowly, or the proud debase."</p><p>He spoke and sate. The prince with transport flew, Hung round his neck, while tears his cheek bedew; Nor less the father pour'd a social flood; They wept abundant, and they wept aloud.</p></div> </div>
