<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For elemental war, and wintry Jove, From Malea's gusty cape his navy drove To bright Lucina's fane; the shelfy coast Where loud Amnisus in the deep is lost. His vessel's moor'd (an incommodious port!) The hero speeded to the Cnossian court: Ardent the partner of his arms to find, In leagues of long commutual friendship join'd. Vain hope! ten suns had warm'd the western strand Since my brave brother, with his Cretan band, Had sail'd for Troy: but to the genial feast My honour'd roof received the royal guest: Beeves for his train the Cnossian peers assign, A public treat, with jars of generous wine. Twelve days while Boreas vex'd the aerial space, My hospitable dome he deign'd to grace: And when the north had ceased the stormy roar, He wing'd his voyage to the Phrygian shore."</p></div> </div>
