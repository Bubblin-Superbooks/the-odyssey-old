<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Deep in the rough recesses of the wood, A lofty copse, the growth of ages, stood; Nor winter's boreal blast, nor thunderous shower, Nor solar ray, could pierce the shady bower. With wither'd foliage strew'd, a heapy store! The warm pavilion of a dreadful boar. Roused by the hounds' and hunters' mingling cries, The savage from his leafy shelter flies; With fiery glare his sanguine eye-balls shine, And bristles high impale his horrid chine.</p></div> </div>
