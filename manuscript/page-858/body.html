<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How on the barbarous Laestrigonian coast, By savage hands his fleet and friends lie lost; How scarce himself survived: he paints the bower, The spells of Circe, and her magic power; His dreadful journey to the realms beneath, To seek Tiresias in the vales of death; How in the doleful mansions lie survey'd His royal mother, pale Anticlea's shade; And friends in battle slain, heroic ghosts! Then how, unharm'd, he pass'd the Syren-coasts, The justling rocks where fierce Charybdis raves, And howling Scylla whirls her thunderous waves, The cave of death! How his companions slay The oxen sacred to the god of day. Till Jove in wrath the rattling tempest guides, And whelms the offenders in the roaring tides: How struggling through the surge lie reach'd the shores Of fair Ogygia and Calypso's bowers; Where the bay blooming nymph constrain'd his stay, With sweet, reluctant, amorous delay;</p></div> </div>
