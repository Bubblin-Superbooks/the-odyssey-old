<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But say, yon jovial troops so gaily dress'd, Is this a bridal or a friendly feast? Or from their deed I rightlier may divine, Unseemly flown with insolence and wine? Unwelcome revellers, whose lawless joy Pains the sage ear, and hurts the sober eye."</p><p>"Magnificence of old (the prince replied) Beneath our roof with virtue could reside; Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board, What time this dome revered her prudent lord; Who now (so Heaven decrees) is doom'd to mourn, Bitter constraint, erroneous and forlorn.</p></div> </div>
