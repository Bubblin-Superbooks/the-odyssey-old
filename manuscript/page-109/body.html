<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Three sons remain'd; to climb with haughty fires The royal bed, Eurynomus aspires; The rest with duteous love his griefs assuage, And ease the sire of half the cares of age. Yet still his Antiphus he loves, he mourns, And, as he stood, he spoke and wept by turns,</p><p>"Since great Ulysses sought the Phrygian plains, Within these walls inglorious silence reigns. Say then, ye peers! by whose commands we meet? Why here once more in solemn council sit? Ye young, ye old, the weighty cause disclose: Arrives some message of invading foes? Or say, does high necessity of state Inspire some patriot, and demand debate? The present synod speaks its author wise; Assist him, Jove, thou regent of the skies!"</p></div> </div>
