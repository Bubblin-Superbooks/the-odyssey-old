<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Whene'er Ulysses roams the realm of night, Should factious power dispute my lineal right, Some other Greeks a fairer claim may plead; To your pretence their title would precede. At least, the sceptre lost, I still should reign Sole o'er my vassals, and domestic train."</p><p>To this Eurymachus: "To Heaven alone Refer the choice to fill the vacant throne. Your patrimonial stores in peace possess; Undoubted, all your filial claim confess: Your private right should impious power invade, The peers of Ithaca would arm in aid. But say, that stranger guest who late withdrew, What and from whence? his name and lineage shew. His grave demeanour and majestic grace Speak him descended of non vulgar race: Did he some loan of ancient right require, Or came forerunner of your sceptr'd sire?"</p></div> </div>
