<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But tell me, stranger, be the truth confess'd, What years have circled since thou saw'st that guest? That hapless guest, alas! for ever gone! Wretch that he was! and that I am! my son! If ever man to misery was born, 'Twas his to suffer, and 'tis mine to mourn! Far from his friends, and from his native reign, He lies a prey to monsters of the main; Or savage beasts his mangled relics tear, Or screaming vultures scatter through the air: Nor could his mother funeral unguents shed; Nor wail'd his father o'er the untimely dead: Nor his sad consort, on the mournful bier, Seal'd his cold eyes, or dropp'd a tender tear!</p><p>"But, tell me who thou art? and what thy race? Thy town, thy parents, and thy native place? Or, if a merchant in pursuit of gain, What port received thy vessel from the main?</p></div> </div>
