<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>mountains on the feather'd race, When, the wide field extended snares beset, With conscious dread they shun the quivering net: No help, no flight; but wounded every way, Headlong they drop; the fowlers seize their prey. On all sides thus they double wound on wound, In prostrate heaps the wretches beat the ground, Unmanly shrieks precede each dying groan, And a red deluge floats the reaking stone.</p><p>Leiodes first before the victor falls: The wretched augur thus for mercy calls: "Oh gracious hear, nor let thy suppliant bleed; Still undishonoured, or by word or deed, Thy house, for me remains; by me repress'd Full oft was check'd the injustice of the rest: Averse they heard me when I counselled well, Their hearts were harden'd, and they justly fell. O spare an augur's consecrated head, Nor add the blameless to the guilty dead."</p></div> </div>
