<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus the fam'd hero, perfected in wiles, With fair similitude of truth beguiles The queen's attentive ear: dissolved in woe, From her bright eyes the tears unbounded flow, As snows collected on the mountain freeze; When milder regions breathe a vernal breeze, The fleecy pile obeys the whispering gales, Ends in a stream, and murmurs through the vales: So, melting with the pleasing tale he told, Down her fair cheek the copious torrent roll'd: She to her present lord laments him lost, And views that object which she wants the most, Withering at heart to see the weeping fair, His eyes look stern, and cast a gloomy stare; Of horn the stiff relentless balls appear, Or globes of iron fix'd in either sphere; Firm wisdom interdicts the softening tear. A speechless interval of grief ensues, Till thus the queen the tender theme renews.</p></div> </div>
