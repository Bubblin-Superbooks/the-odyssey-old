<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"'O friends, a thousand ways frail mortals lead To the cold tomb, and dreadful all to tread; But dreadful most, when by a slow decay Pale hunger wastes the manly strength away. Why cease ye then to implore the powers above, And offer hecatombs to thundering Jove? Why seize ye not yon beeves, and fleecy prey? Arise unanimous; arise and slay! And if the gods ordain a safe return, To Phoebus shrines shall rise, and altars burn. But should the powers that o'er mankind preside Decree to plunge us in the whelming tide, Better to rush at once to shades below Than linger life away, and nourish woe.'</p><p>"Thus he: the beeves around securely stray, When swift to ruin they invade the prey; They seize, they kill!--but for the rite divine. The barley fail'd, and for libations wine. Swift from the oak they strip the shady pride; And verdant leaves the flowery cake supplied.</p></div> </div>
