(Replied the king elated with his praise) My strength were still, as once in better days: When the bold Cephalens the leaguer form'd. And proud Nericus trembled as I storm'd. Such were I now, not absent from your deed When the last sun beheld the suitors bleed, This arm had aided yours, this hand bestrown Our shores with death, and push'd the slaughter on; Nor had the sire been separate from the son."</p><p>They communed thus; while homeward bent their way The swains, fatigued with labours of the day: Dolius, the first, the venerable man; And next his sons, a long succeeding train.</p></div> </div>
