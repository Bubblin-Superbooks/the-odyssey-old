<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus spoke the king; the attending peers obey; In state they move, Alcinous lends the way; His golden lyre Demodocus unstrung, High on a column in the palace hung; And guided by a herald's guardian cares, Majestic to the lists of Fame repairs.</p><p>Now swarms the populace: a countless throng, Youth and boar age; and man drives man along. The games begin; ambitious of the prize, Acroneus, Thoon, and Eretmeus rise; The prize Ocyalus and Prymneus claim, Anchialus and Ponteus, chiefs of fame. There Proreus, Nautes, Eratreus, appear And famed Amphialus, Polyneus' heir; Euryalus, like Mars terrific, rose, When clad in wrath he withers hosts of foes; Naubolides with grace unequall'd shone, Or equall'd by Laodamas alone. With these came forth Ambasineus the strong: And three brave sons, from great Alcinous sprung.</p></div> </div>
