Then to my native country had I sail'd: But, the cape doubled, adverse winds prevail'd. Strong was the tide, which by the northern blast Impell'd, our vessels on Cythera cast, Nine days our fleet the uncertain tempest bore Far in wide ocean, and from sight of shore: The tenth we touch'd, by various errors toss'd, The land of Lotus and the flowery coast. We climb'd the beach, and springs of water found, Then spread our hasty banquet on the ground. Three men were sent, deputed from the crew (A herald one) the dubious coast to view, And learn what habitants possess'd the place.</p></div> </div>
