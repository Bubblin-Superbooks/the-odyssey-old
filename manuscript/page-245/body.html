<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But oh, beloved by Heaven! reserved to thee A happier lot the smiling Fates decree: Free from that law, beneath whose mortal sway Matter is changed, and varying forms decay, Elysium shall be thine: the blissful plains Of utmost earth, where Rhadamanthus reigns. Joys ever young, unmix'd with pain or fear, Fill the wide circle of the eternal year: Stern winter smiles on that auspicious clime: The fields are florid with unfading prime; From the bleak pole no winds inclement blow, Mould the round hail, or flake the fleecy snow; But from the breezy deep the blest inhale The fragrant murmurs of the western gale. This grace peculiar will the gods afford To thee, the son of Jove, and beauteous Helen's lord.'</p><p>"He ceased, and plunging in the vast profound, Beneath the god and whirling billows bound.</p></div> </div>
