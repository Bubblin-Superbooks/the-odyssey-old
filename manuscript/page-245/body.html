<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Alas! for this (the prudent man replies) Against Ulysses shall thy anger rise? Loved and adored, O goddess as thou art, Forgive the weakness of a human heart. Though well I see thy graces far above The dear, though mortal, object of my love, Of youth eternal well the difference know, And the short date of fading charms below; Yet every day, while absent thus I roam, I languish to return and die at home. Whate'er the gods shall destine me to bear; In the black ocean or the watery war, 'Tis mine to master with a constant mind; Inured to perils, to the worst resign'd, By seas, by wars, so many dangers run; Still I can suffer; their high will he done!"</p></div> </div>
