Permit me (cries Telemachus) to claim A son's just right. No Grecian prince but I Has power this bow to grant or to deny. Of all that Ithaca's rough hills contain, And all wide Elis' courser-breeding plain, To me alone my father's arms descend; And mine alone they are, to give or lend. Retire, O queen! thy household task resume, Tend, with thy maids, the labours of thy loom; The bow, the darts, and arms of chivalry, These cares to man belong, and most to me."</p></div> </div>
