<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In sacred shade his honour'd mansion stood Amidst Apollo's consecrated wood; Him, and his house, Heaven moved my mind to save, And costly presents in return he gave; Seven golden talents to perfection wrought, A silver bowl that held a copious draught, And twelve large vessels of unmingled wine, Mellifluous, undecaying, and divine! Which now, some ages from his race conceal'd, The hoary sire in gratitude reveal'd. Such was the wine: to quench whose fervent steam Scarce twenty measures from the living stream To cool one cup sufficed: the goblet crown'd Breathed aromatic fragrances around. Of this an ample vase we heaved aboard, And brought another with provisions stored. My soul foreboded I should find the bower Of some fell monster, fierce with barbarous power; Some rustic wretch, who lived in Heaven's despite, Contemning laws, and trampling on the right.</p></div> </div>
