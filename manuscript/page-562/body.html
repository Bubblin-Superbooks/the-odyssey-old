No prince will let Ulysses' heir remove Without some pledge, some monument of love: These will the caldron, these the tripod give; From those the well-pair'd mules we shall receive, Or bowl emboss'd whose golden figures live."</p><p>To whom the youth, for prudence famed, replied: "O monarch, care of heaven! thy people's pride! No friend in Ithaca my place supplies, No powerful hands are there, no watchful eyes: My stores exposed and fenceless house demand The speediest succour from my guardian hand; Lest, in a search too anxious and too vain, Of one lost joy, I lose what yet remain."</p></div> </div>
