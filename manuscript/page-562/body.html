<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But should the powers that o'er mankind preside Decree to plunge us in the whelming tide, Better to rush at once to shades below Than linger life away, and nourish woe.'</p><p>"Thus he: the beeves around securely stray, When swift to ruin they invade the prey; They seize, they kill!--but for the rite divine. The barley fail'd, and for libations wine. Swift from the oak they strip the shady pride; And verdant leaves the flowery cake supplied.</p><p>"With prayer they now address the ethereal train, Slay the selected beeves, and flay the slain; The thighs, with fat involved, divide with art, Strew'd o'er with morsels cut from every part. Water, instead of wine, is brought in urns, And pour'd profanely as the victim burns.</p></div> </div>
