(the god replies Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies;) Hath not long since thy knowing soul decreed The chief's return should make the guilty bleed. 'Tis done, and at thy will the Fates succeed. Yet hear the issue: Since Ulysses' hand Has slain the suitors, Heaven shall bless the land. None now the kindred of the unjust shall own; Forgot the slaughter'd brother and the son: Each future day increase of wealth shall bring, And o'er the past Oblivion stretch her wing. Long shall Ulysses in his empire rest, His people blessing, by his people bless'd. Let all be peace."--He said, and gave the nod That binds the Fates; the sanction of the god And prompt to execute the eternal will, Descended Pallas from the Olympian hill.</p></div> </div>
