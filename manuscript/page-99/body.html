Or from their deed I rightlier may divine, Unseemly flown with insolence and wine? Unwelcome revellers, whose lawless joy Pains the sage ear, and hurts the sober eye."</p><p>"Magnificence of old (the prince replied) Beneath our roof with virtue could reside; Unblamed abundance crowned the royal board, What time this dome revered her prudent lord; Who now (so Heaven decrees) is doom'd to mourn, Bitter constraint, erroneous and forlorn. Better the chief, on Ilion's hostile plain, Had fall'n surrounded with his warlike train; Or safe return'd, the race of glory pass'd, New to his friends' embrace, and breathed his last! Then grateful Greece with streaming eyes would raise, Historic marbles to record his praise; His praise, eternal on the faithful stone, Had with transmissive honour graced his son.</p></div> </div>
