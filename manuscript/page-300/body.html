As when the polypus, from forth his cave Torn with full force, reluctant beats the wave, His ragged claws are stuck with stones and sands; So the rough rock had shagg'd Ulysses hands, And now had perish'd, whelm'd beneath the main, The unhappy man; e'en fate had been in vain; But all-subduing Pallas lent her power, And prudence saved him in the needful hour. Beyond the beating surge his course he bore, (A wider circle, but in sight of shore), With longing eyes, observing, to survey Some smooth ascent, or safe sequester'd bay.</p></div> </div>
