Lo! the peers around But wait thy word, the gentle guest to grace, And seat him fair in some distinguish'd place. Let first the herald due libation pay To Jove, who guides the wanderer on his way: Then set the genial banquet in his view, And give the stranger-guest a stranger's due."</p><p>His sage advice the listening king obeys, He stretch'd his hand the prudent chief to raise, And from his seat Laodamas removed (The monarch's offspring, and his best-beloved); There next his side the godlike hero sate; With stars of silver shone the bed of state. The golden ewer a beauteous handmaid brings, Replenish'd from the cool translucent springs, Whose polish'd vase with copious streams supplies A silver layer of capacious size.</p></div> </div>
