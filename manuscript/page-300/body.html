<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oft with some favour'd traveller they stray, And shine before him all the desert way; With social intercourse, and face to face, The friends and guardians of our pious race. So near approach we their celestial kind, By justice, truth, and probity of mind; As our dire neighbours of Cyclopean birth Match in fierce wrong the giant-sons of earth."</p><p>"Let no such thought (with modest grace rejoin'd The prudent Greek) possess the royal mind. Alas! a mortal, like thyself, am I; No glorious native of yon azure sky: In form, ah how unlike their heavenly kind! How more inferior in the gifts of mind! Alas, a mortal! most oppress'd of those Whom Fate has loaded with a weight of woes; By a sad train of Miseries alone Distinguish'd long, and second now to none! By Heaven's high will compell'd from shore to shore; With Heaven's high will prepared to suffer more.</p></div> </div>
