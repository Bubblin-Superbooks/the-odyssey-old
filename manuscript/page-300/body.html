Propitious Pallas, to secure her care, Around him spread a veil of thicken'd air; To shun the encounter of the vulgar crowd, Insulting still, inquisitive and loud. When near the famed Phaeacian walls he drew, The beauteous city opening to his view, His step a virgin met, and stood before: A polish'd urn the seeming virgin bore, And youthful smiled; but in the low disguise Lay hid the goddess with the azure eyes.</p><p>"Show me, fair daughter (thus the chief demands), The house of him who rules these happy lands Through many woes and wanderings, do I come To good Alcinous' hospitable dome. Far from my native coast, I rove alone, A wretched stranger, and of all unknown!"</p></div> </div>
