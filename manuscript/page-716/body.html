Her cheeks the warmer blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air. An ivory seat with silver ringlets graced, By famed Icmalius wrought, the menials placed: With ivory silver'd thick the footstool shone, O'er which the panther's various hide was thrown. The sovereign seat with graceful air she press'd; To different tasks their toil the nymphs address'd: The golden goblets some, and some restored From stains of luxury the polish'd board: These to remove the expiring embers came, While those with unctuous fir foment the flame.</p></div> </div>
