<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Swift from above descends the royal fair (Her beauteous cheeks the blush of Venus wear, Chasten'd with coy Diana's pensive air); Hangs o'er her son, in his embraces dies; Rains kisses on his neck, his face, his eyes: Few words she spoke, though much she had to say; And scarce those few, for tears, could force their way.</p><p>"Light of my eyes: he comes! unhoped-for joy! Has Heaven from Pylos brought my lovely boy? So snatch'd from all our cares!--Tell, hast thou known Thy father's fate, and tell me all thy own."</p><p>"Oh dearest! most revered of womankind! Cease with those tears to melt a manly mind (Replied the prince); nor be our fates deplored, From death and treason to thy arms restored.</p></div> </div>
