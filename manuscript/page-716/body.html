His hand to Euryclea's mouth applied, "Art thou foredoom'd my pest? (the hero cried:) Thy milky founts my infant lips have drain'd; And have the Fates thy babbling age ordain'd To violate the life thy youth sustain'd? An exile have I told, with weeping eyes, Full twenty annual suns in distant skies; At length return'd, some god inspires thy breast To know thy king, and here I stand confess'd. This heaven-discover'd truth to thee consign'd, Reserve the treasure of thy inmost mind: Else, if the gods my vengeful arm sustain, And prostrate to my sword the suitor-train; With their lewd mates, thy undistinguish'd age Shall bleed a victim to vindictive rage."</p></div> </div>
