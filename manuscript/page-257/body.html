Go, wander helpless on the watery way; Thus, thus find out the destined shore, and then (If Jove ordains it) mix with happier men. Whate'er thy fate, the ills our wrath could raise Shall last remember'd in thy best of days."</p><p>This said, his sea-green steeds divide the foam, And reach high Aegae and the towery dome. Now, scarce withdrawn the fierce earth-shaking power, Jove's daughter Pallas watch'd the favouring hour. Back to their caves she bade the winds to fly; And hush'd the blustering brethren of the sky. The drier blasts alone of Boreas away, And bear him soft on broken waves away; With gentle force impelling to that shore, Where fate has destined he shall toil no more.</p></div> </div>
