Selected from my stores, of matchless price, An urn shall recompense your prudent choice; By Vulcan's art, the verge with gold enchased. A pledge the sceptred power of Sidon gave, When to his realm I plough'd the orient wave."</p><p>Thus they alternate; while, with artful care, The menial train the regal feast prepare.
