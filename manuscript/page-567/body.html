<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then Jove in anger bids his thunders roll, And forky lightnings flash from pole to pole: Fierce at our heads his deadly bolt he aims, Red with uncommon wrath, and wrapp'd in flames: Full on the bark it fell; now high, now low, Toss'd and retoss'd, it reel'd beneath the blow; At once into the main the crew it shook: Sulphurous odours rose, and smouldering smoke. Like fowl that haunt the floods, they sink, they rise, Now lost, now seen, with shrieks and dreadful cries; And strive to gain the bark, but Jove denies. Firm at the helm I stand, when fierce the main Rush'd with dire noise, and dash'd the sides in twain; Again impetuous drove the furious blast, Snapp'd the strong helm, and bore to sea the mast.</p></div> </div>
