Freighted, it seems, with toys of every sort, A ship of Sidon anchor'd in our port; What time it chanced the palace entertain'd, Skill'd in rich works, a woman of their land: This nymph, where anchor'd the Phoenician train, To wash her robes descending to the main, A smooth tongued sailor won her to his mind (For love deceives the best of womankind). A sudden trust from sudden liking grew; She told her name, her race, and all she knew, 'I too (she cried) from glorious Sidon came, My father Arybas, of wealthy fame: But, snatch'd by pirates from my native place, The Taphians sold me to this man's embrace.'</p><p>"'Haste then (the false designing youth replied), Haste to thy country; love shall be thy guide; Haste to thy father's house, thy father's breast, For still he lives, and lives with riches blest.'</p></div> </div>
