<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The vulgar of my sex I most exceed In real fame, when most humane my deed; And vainly to the praise of queen aspire, If, stranger! I permit that mean attire Beneath the feastful bower. A narrow space Confines the circle of our destin'd race; 'Tis ours with good the scanty round to grace. Those who to cruel wrong their state abuse, Dreaded in life the mutter'd curse pursues; By death disrobed of all their savage powers, Then, licensed rage her hateful prey devours. But he whose inborn worth his acts commend, Of gentle soul, to human race a friend; The wretched he relieves diffuse his fame, And distant tongues extol the patron-name."</p><p>"Princess? (he cried) in vain your bounties flow On me, confirm'd and obstinate in woe.</p></div> </div>
