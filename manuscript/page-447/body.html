Our eager sailors seize the fair retreat, And bound within the port their crowded fleet: For here retired the sinking billows sleep, And smiling calmness silver'd o'er the deep. I only in the bay refused to moor, And fix'd without, my halsers to the shore.</p><p>"From thence we climb'd a point, whose airy brow Commands the prospect of the plains below; No tracks of beasts, or signs of men, we found, But smoky volumes rolling from the ground. Two with our herald thither we command, With speed to learn what men possess'd the land.</p></div> </div>
