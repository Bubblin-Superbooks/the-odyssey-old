<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus in the regions of eternal shade Conferr'd the mournful phantoms of the dead; While from the town, Ulysses and his band Pass'd to Laertes' cultivated land. The ground himself had purchased with his pain, And labour made the rugged soil a plain, There stood his mansion of the rural sort, With useful buildings round the lowly court; Where the few servants that divide his care Took their laborious rest, and homely fare; And one Sicilian matron, old and sage, With constant duty tends his drooping age.</p><p>Here now arriving, to his rustic band And martial son, Ulysses gave command: "Enter the house, and of the bristly swine Select the largest to the powers divine. Alone, and unattended, let me try If yet I share the old man's memory: If those dim eyes can yet Ulysses know (Their light and dearest object long ago), Now changed with time, with absence and with woe."</p></div> </div>
