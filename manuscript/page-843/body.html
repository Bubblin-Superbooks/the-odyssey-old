His lineage and paternal clime declare: Dim through the eclipse of fate, the rays divine Of sovereign state with faded splendour shine. If monarchs by the gods are plunged in woe, To what abyss are we foredoom'd to go!" Then affable he thus the chief address'd, Whilst with pathetic warmth his hand he press'd:</p><p>"Stranger, may fate a milder aspect show, And spin thy future with a whiter clue! O Jove! for ever death to human cries; The tyrant, not the father of the skies! Unpiteous of the race thy will began! The fool of fate, thy manufacture, man, With penury, contempt, repulse, and care, The galling load of life is doom'd to bear.</p></div> </div>
