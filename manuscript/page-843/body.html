<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Great is thy skill, O father! great thy toil, Thy careful hand is stamp'd on all the soil, Thy squadron'd vineyards well thy art declare, The olive green, blue fig, and pendent pear; And not one empty spot escapes thy care. On every plant and tree thy cares are shown, Nothing neglected, but thyself alone. Forgive me, father, if this fault I blame; Age so advanced, may some indulgence claim. Not for thy sloth, I deem thy lord unkind: Nor speaks thy form a mean or servile mind; I read a monarch in that princely air, The same thy aspect, if the same thy care; Soft sleep, fair garments, and the joys of wine, These are the rights of age, and should be thine. Who then thy master, say? and whose the land So dress'd and managed by thy skilful hand? But chief, oh tell me! (what I question most) Is this the far-famed Ithacensian coast?</p></div> </div>
