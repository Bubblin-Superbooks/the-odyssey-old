<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The earth o'erburden'd groan'd beneath their weight, None but Orion e'er surpassed their height: The wondrous youths had scarce nine winters told, When high in air, tremendous to behold, Nine ells aloft they rear'd their towering head, And full nine cubits broad their shoulders spread. Proud of their strength, and more than mortal size, The gods they challenge, and affect the skies: Heaved on Olympus tottering Ossa stood; On Ossa, Pelion nods with all his wood. Such were they youths I had they to manhood grown Almighty Jove had trembled on his throne, But ere the harvest of the beard began To bristle on the chin, and promise man, His shafts Apollo aim'd; at once they sound, And stretch the giant monsters o'er the ground.</p><p>"There mournful Phaedra with sad Procris moves, Both beauteous shades, both hapless in their loves;</p></div> </div>
