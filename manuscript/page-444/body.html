We leap'd on shore, and with a scanty feast Our thirst and hunger hastily repress'd; That done, two chosen heralds straight attend Our second progress to my royal friend; And him amidst his jovial sons we found; The banquet steaming, and the goblets crown'd; There humbly stoop'd with conscious shame and awe, Nor nearer than the gate presumed to draw.</p></div> </div>
