Yet secret go; for numerous are my foes, And here at least I may in peace repose."</p><p>To whom the swain: "I hear and I obey: But old Laertes weeps his life away, And deems thee lost: shall I speed employ To bless his age: a messenger of joy? The mournful hour that tore his son away Sent the sad sire in solitude to stray; Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe, He dress'd the vine, and bade the garden blow, Nor food nor wine refused; but since the day That you to Pylos plough'd the watery way, Nor wine nor food he tastes; but, sunk in woes, Wild springs the vine, no more the garden blows, Shut from the walks of men, to pleasure lost, Pensive and pale he wanders half a ghost."</p></div> </div>
