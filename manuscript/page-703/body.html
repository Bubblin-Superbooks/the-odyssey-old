<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pisander bears a necklace wrought with art: And every peer, expressive of his heart, A gift bestows: this done, the queen ascends, And slow behind her damsel train attends.</p><p>Then to the dance they form the vocal strain, Till Hesperus leads forth the starry train; And now he raises, as the daylight fades, His golden circlet in the deepening shades: Three vases heap'd with copious fires display O'er all the palace a fictitious day; From space to space the torch wide-beaming burns, And sprightly damsels trim the rays by turns.</p><p>To whom the king: "Ill suits your sex to stay Alone with men! ye modest maids, away! Go, with the queen; the spindle guide; or cull (The partners of her cares) the silver wool; Be it my task the torches to supply E'en till the morning lamp adorns the sky; E'en till the morning, with unwearied care, Sleepless I watch; for I have learn'd to bear."</p></div> </div>
