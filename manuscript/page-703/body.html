<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Swift to the queen a herald flies to impart Her son's return, and ease a parent's heart: Lest a sad prey to ever-musing cares, Pale grief destroy what time awhile forbears. The incautious herald with impatience burns, And cries aloud, "Thy son, O queen, returns;" Eumaeus sage approach'd the imperial throne, And breathed his mandate to her ear alone, Then measured back the way. The suitor band, Stung to the soul, abash'd, confounded, stand; And issuing from the dome, before the gate, With clouded looks, a pale assembly sate.</p><p>At length Eurymachus: "Our hopes are vain; Telemachus in triumph sails the main. Haste, rear the mast, the swelling shroud display; Haste, to our ambush'd friends the news convey!"</p></div> </div>
