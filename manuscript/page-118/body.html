Destruction sure o'er all your heads impends Ulysses comes, and death his steps attends. Nor to the great alone is death decreed; We and our guilty Ithaca must bleed. Why cease we then the wrath of heaven to stay? Be humbled all, and lead, ye great! the way. For lo? my words no fancied woes relate; I speak from science and the voice of fate.</p><p>"When great Ulysses sought the Phrygian shores To shake with war proud Ilion's lofty towers, Deeds then undone me faithful tongue foretold: Heaven seal'd my words, and you those deeds behold. I see (I cried) his woes, a countless train; I see his friends o'erwhelm'd beneath the main; How twice ten years from shore to shore he roams: Now twice ten years are past, and now he comes!"</p></div> </div>
