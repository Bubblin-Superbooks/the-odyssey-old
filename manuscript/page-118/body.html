Oft, Jove's ethereal rays (resistless fire) The chanters soul and raptured song inspire Instinct divine? nor blame severe his choice, Warbling the Grecian woes with heart and voice; For novel lays attract our ravish'd ears; But old, the mind with inattention hears: Patient permit the sadly pleasing strain; Familiar now with grief, your tears refrain, And in the public woe forget your own; You weep not for a perish'd lord alone. What Greeks new wandering in the Stygian gloom, Wish your Ulysses shared an equal doom! Your widow'd hours, apart, with female toil And various labours of the loom beguile; There rule, from palace-cares remote and free; That care to man belongs, and most to me."</p></div> </div>
