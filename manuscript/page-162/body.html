To pay whole honours to the shades of hell, We check'd our haste, by pious office bound, And laid our old companion in the ground. And now the rites discharged, our course we keep Far on the gloomy bosom of the deep: Soon as Malae's misty tops arise, Sudden the Thunderer blackens all the skies, And the winds whistle, and the surges roll Mountains on mountains, and obscure the pole.

There stands a rock, high, eminent and steep, Whose shaggy brow o'erhangs the shady deep, And views Gortyna on the western side;</p></div> </div>
