But grant, oh grant, our loss we may retrieve; A favour you, and you alone can give.'</p><p>"Thus I with art to move their pity tried, And touch'd the youths; but their stern sire replied: 'Vile wretch, begone! this instant I command Thy fleet accursed to leave our hallow'd land. His baneful suit pollutes these bless'd abodes, Whose fate proclaims him hateful to the gods.'</p><p>"Thus fierce he said: we sighing went our way, And with desponding hearts put off to sea. The sailors spent with toils their folly mourn, But mourn in vain; no prospect of return Six days and nights a doubtful course we steer, The next proud Lamos' stately towers appear, And Laestrygonia's gates arise distinct in air.</p></div> </div>
