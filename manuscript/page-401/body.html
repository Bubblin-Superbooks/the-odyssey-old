<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We boldly landed on the hostile place, And sack'd the city, and destroy'd the race, Their wives made captive, their possessions shared, And every soldier found a like reward I then advised to fly; not so the rest, Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast: The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay, And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day. Meantime the Cicons, to their holds retired, Call on the Cicons, with new fury fired; With early morn the gather'd country swarms, And all the continent is bright with arms; Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers O'erspread the land, when spring descends in showers: All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare, Or from the bounding courser urge the war.</p></div> </div>
