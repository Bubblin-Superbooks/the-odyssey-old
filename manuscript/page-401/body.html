Radiant with starry studs, a silver seat Received my limbs: a footstool eased my feet, She mix'd the potion, fraudulent of soul; The poison mantled in the golden bowl. I took, and quaff'd it, confident in heaven. Then waved the wand, and then the word was given. 'Hence to thy fellows! (dreadful she began:) Go, be a beast!'--I heard, and yet was man.</p><p>"Then, sudden whirling, like a waving flame, My beamy falchion, I assault the dame. Struck with unusual fear, she trembling cries, She faints, she falls; she lifts her weeping eyes.</p></div> </div>
