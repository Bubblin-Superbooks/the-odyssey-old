<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As down the hill I solitary go, Some power divine, who pities human woe, Sent a tall stag, descending from the wood, To cool his fervour in the crystal flood; Luxuriant on the wave-worn bank he lay, Stretch'd forth and panting in the sunny ray. I launch'd my spear, and with a sudden wound Transpierced his back, and fix'd him to the ground. He falls, and mourns his fate with human cries: Through the wide wound the vital spirit flies. I drew, and casting on the river's side The bloody spear, his gather'd feet I tied With twining osiers which the bank supplied.</p></div> </div>
