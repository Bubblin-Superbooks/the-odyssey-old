<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There was a day, when with the scornful great I swell'd in pomp and arrogance of state; Proud of the power that to high birth belongs; And used that power to justify my wrongs. Then let not man be proud; but firm of mind, Bear the best humbly; and the worst resign'd; Be dumb when Heaven afflicts! unlike yon train Of haughty spoilers, insolently vain; Who make their queen and all her wealth a prey: But vengeance and Ulysses wing their way. O may'st thou, favour'd by some guardian power, Far, far be distant in that deathful hour! For sure I am, if stern Ulysses breathe, These lawless riots end in blood and death."</p><p>Then to the gods the rosy juice he pours, And the drain'd goblet to the chief restores.</p></div> </div>
