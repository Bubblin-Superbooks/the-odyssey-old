With wholesome herbage mix'd, the direful bane Of vegetable venom taints the plain; From Paeon sprung, their patron-god imparts To all the Pharian race his healing arts. The beverage now prepared to inspire the feast, The circle thus the beauteous queen addressed:</p><p>"Throned in omnipotence, supremest Jove Tempers the fates of human race above; By the firm sanction of his sovereign will, Alternate are decreed our good and ill. To feastful mirth be this white hour assign'd.
