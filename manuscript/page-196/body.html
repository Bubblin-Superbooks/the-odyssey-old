His former seat beside the king he found (His people's father with his peers around); All placed at ease the holy banquet join, And in the dazzling goblet laughs the wine.</p><p>The rage of thirst and hunger now suppress'd, The monarch turns him to his royal guest; And for the promised journey bids prepare The smooth hair'd horses, and the rapid car. Observant of his word, tire word scarce spoke, The sons obey, and join them to the yoke. Then bread and wine a ready handmaid brings, And presents, such as suit the state of kings.</p></div> </div>
