<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Some heavenly power averse my stay constrains: O, piteous of my fate, vouchsafe to show (For what's sequester'd from celestial view?) What power becalms the innavigable seas? What guilt provokes him, and what vows appease?'</p><p>"I ceased, when affable the goddess cried: 'Observe, and in the truths I speak confide; The oracular seer frequents the Pharian coast, From whose high bed my birth divine I boast; Proteus, a name tremendous o'er the main, The delegate of Neptune's watery reign. Watch with insidious care his known abode; There fast in chains constrain the various god; Who bound, obedient to superior force, Unerring will prescribe your destined course. If, studious on your realms, you then demand Their state, since last you left your natal land, Instant the god obsequious will disclose Bright tracts of glory or a cloud of woes.'</p></div> </div>
