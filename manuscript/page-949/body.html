There, we thy relics, great Achilles! blend With dear Patroclus, thy departed friend: In the same urn a separate space contains Thy next beloved, Antilochus' remains. Now all the sons of warlike Greece surround Thy destined tomb and cast a mighty mound; High on the shore the growing hill we raise, That wide the extended Hellespont surveys; Where all, from age to age, who pass the coast, May point Achilles' tomb, and hail the mighty ghost.</p></div> </div>
