The solid gate its fury scarcely bounds; Pierced through and through the solid gate resounds, Then to the prince: "Nor have I wrought thee shame; Nor err'd this hand unfaithful to its aim; Nor prov'd the toil too hard; nor have I lost That ancient vigour, once my pride and boast. Ill I deserved these haughty peers' disdain; Now let them comfort their dejected train, In sweet repast their present hour employ, Nor wait till evening for the genial joy: Then to the lute's soft voice prolong the night; Music, the banquet's most refined delight."</p></div> </div>
