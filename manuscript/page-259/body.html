<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Whoe'er thou art, before whose stream unknown I bend, a suppliant at thy watery throne, Hear, azure king! nor let me fly in vain To thee from Neptune and the raging main Heaven hears and pities hapless men like me, For sacred even to gods is misery: Let then thy waters give the weary rest, And save a suppliant, and a man distress'd."</p><p>He pray'd, and straight the gentle stream subsides, Detains the rushing current of his tides, Before the wanderer smooths the watery way, And soft receives him from the rolling sea. That moment, fainting as he touch'd the shore, He dropp'd his sinewy arms: his knees no more Perform'd their office, or his weight upheld: His swoln heart heaved; his bloated body swell'd: From mouth and nose the briny torrent ran; And lost in lassitude lay all the man, Deprived of voice, of motion, and of breath;</p></div> </div>
