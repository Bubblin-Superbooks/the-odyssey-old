<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Happy! thrice happy! who, in battle slain, Press'd in Atrides' cause the Trojan plain! Oh! had I died before that well-fought wall! Had some distinguish'd day renown'd my fall (Such as was that when showers of javelins fled From conquering Troy around Achilles dead), All Greece had paid me solemn funerals then, And spread my glory with the sons of men. A shameful fate now hides my hapless head, Unwept, unnoted, and for ever dead!"</p><p>A mighty wave rush'd o'er him as he spoke, The raft is cover'd, and the mast is broke; Swept from the deck and from the rudder torn, Far on the swelling surge the chief was borne; While by the howling tempest rent in twain Flew sail and sail-yards rattling o'er the main.</p></div> </div>
