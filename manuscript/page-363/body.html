He next betakes him to his evening cares, And, sitting down, to milk his flocks prepares; Of half their udders eases first the dams, Then to the mother's teat submits the lambs; Half the white stream to hardening cheese be press'd, And high in wicker-baskets heap'd: the rest, Reserved in bowls, supplied his nightly feast.

We stand discover'd by the rising fires; Askance the giant glares, and thus inquires:</p><p>"'What are ye, guests? on what adventure, say, Thus far ye wander through the watery way? Pirates perhaps, who seek through seas unknown The lives of others, and expose your own?'</p></div> </div>
