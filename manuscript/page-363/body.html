<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main, Then conquest crown'd the fierce Ciconian train. Six brave companions from each ship we lost, The rest escape in haste, and quit the coast, With sails outspread we fly the unequal strife, Sad for their loss, but joyful of our life. Yet as we fled, our fellows' rites we paid, And thrice we call'd on each unhappy shade,</p><p>"Meanwhile the god, whose hand the thunder forms, Drives clouds on clouds, and blackens heaven with storms: Wide o'er the waste the rage of Boreas sweeps, And night rush'd headlong on the shaded deeps. Now here, now there, the giddy ships are borne, And all the rattling shrouds in fragments torn. We furl'd the sail, we plied the labouring oar, Took down our masts, and row'd our ships to shore. Two tedious days and two long nights we lay, O'erwatch'd and batter'd in the naked bay.</p></div> </div>
