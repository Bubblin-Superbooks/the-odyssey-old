<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> not so the rest, Who stay'd to revel, and prolong the feast: The fatted sheep and sable bulls they slay, And bowls flow round, and riot wastes the day. Meantime the Cicons, to their holds retired, Call on the Cicons, with new fury fired; With early morn the gather'd country swarms, And all the continent is bright with arms; Thick as the budding leaves or rising flowers O'erspread the land, when spring descends in showers: All expert soldiers, skill'd on foot to dare, Or from the bounding courser urge the war. Now fortune changes (so the Fates ordain); Our hour was come to taste our share of pain. Close at the ships the bloody fight began, Wounded they wound, and man expires on man. Long as the morning sun increasing bright O'er heaven's pure azure spreads the glowing light, Promiscuous death the form of war confounds, Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds;</p></div> </div>
