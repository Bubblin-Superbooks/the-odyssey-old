These solemn vows and holy offerings paid To all the phantom nations of the dead, Be next thy care the sable sheep to place Full o'er the pit, and hellward turn their face: But from the infernal rite thine eye withdraw, And back to Ocean glance with reverend awe. Sudden shall skim along the dusky glades Thin airy shoals, and visionary shades. Then give command the sacrifice to haste, Let the flay'd victims in the flame be cast, And sacred vows and mystic song applied To grisly Pluto and his gloomy bride. Wide o'er the pool thy falchion waved around Shall drive the spectres from unbidden ground: The sacred draught shall all the dead forbear, Till awful from the shades arise the seer. Let him, oraculous, the end, the way, The turns of all thy future fate display, Thy pilgrimage to come, and remnant of thy day.'</p></div> </div>
