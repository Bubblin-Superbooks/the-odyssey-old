Yet by another sign thy offspring know; The several trees you gave me long ago, While yet a child, these fields I loved to trace, And trod thy footsteps with unequal pace; To every plant in order as we came, Well-pleased, you told its nature and its name, Whate'er my childish fancy ask'd, bestow'd: Twelve pear-trees, bowing with their pendent load, And ten, that red with blushing apples glow'd; Full fifty purple figs; and many a row Of various vines that then began to blow, A future vintage! when the Hours produce Their latent buds, and Sol exalts the juice."</p></div> </div>
