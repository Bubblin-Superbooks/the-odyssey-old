A secret instinct moves her troubled breast, Of her long absent lord from thee to gain Some light, and soothe her soul's eternal pain. If true, if faithful thou, her grateful mind Of decent robes a present has design'd: So finding favour in the royal eye, Thy other wants her subjects shall supply."</p><p>"Fair truth alone (the patient man replied) My words shall dictate, and my lips shall guide. To him, to me, one common lot was given, In equal woes, alas! involved by Heaven. Much of his fates I know; but check'd by fear I stand; the hand of violence is here: Here boundless wrongs the starry skies invade, And injured suppliants seek in vain for aid.</p></div> </div>
