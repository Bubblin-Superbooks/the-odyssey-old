<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Vain efforts with superior power compress'd, Me with reluctance thus the seer address'd; 'Say, son of Atreus, say what god inspired This daring fraud, and what the boon desired?' I thus: 'O thou, whose certain eye foresees The fix'd event of fate's remote decrees; After long woes, and various toil endured, Still on this desert isle my fleet is moor'd, Unfriended of the gales. All-knowing, say, What godhead interdicts the watery way? What vows repentant will the power appease, To speed a prosperous voyage o'er the seas.'</p><p>"'To Jove (with stern regard the god replies) And all the offended synod of the skies, Just hecatombs with due devotion slain, Thy guilt absolved, a prosperous voyage gain.</p></div> </div>
