As when some heaven-taught poet charms the ear (Suspending sorrow with celestial strain Breathed from the gods to soften human pain) Time steals away with unregarded wing, And the soul hears him, though he cease to sing</p><p>"Ulysses late he saw, on Cretan ground (His fathers guest), for Minos' birth renown'd. He now but waits the wind to waft him o'er, With boundless treasure, from Thesprotia's shore."</p><p>To this the queen: "The wanderer let me hear, While yon luxurious race indulge their cheer, Devour the grazing ox, and browsing goat, And turn my generous vintage down their throat. For where's an arm, like thine, Ulysses! strong, To curb wild riot, and to punish wrong?"</p></div> </div>
