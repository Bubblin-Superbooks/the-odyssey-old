<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> In this suspense bright Helen graced the room; Before her breathed a gale of rich perfume. So moves, adorn'd with each attractive grace, The silver shafted goddess of the chase! The seat of majesty Adraste brings, With art illustrious, for the pomp of kings; To spread the pall (beneath the regal chair) Of softest wool, is bright Alcippe's care. A silver canister, divinely wrought, In her soft hands the beauteous Phylo brought; To Sparta's queen of old the radiant vase Alcandra gave, a pledge of royal grace; For Polybus her lord (whose sovereign sway The wealthy tribes of Pharian Thebes obey), When to that court Atrides came, caress'd With vast munificence the imperial guest: Two lavers from the richest ore refined, With silver tripods, the kind host assign'd; And bounteous from the royal treasure told Ten equal talents of refulgent gold.</p></div> </div>
