<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Full where the dome its shining valves expands, Sudden before the rival powers she stands; And, veiling, decent, with a modest shade Her cheek, indignant to Antinous said:</p><p>"O void of faith! of all bad men the worst! Renown'd for wisdom, by the abuse accursed! Mistaking fame proclaims thy generous mind: Thy deeds denote thee of the basest kind. Wretch! to destroy a prince that friendship gives, While in his guest his murderer he receives; Nor dread superior Jove, to whom belong The cause of suppliants, and revenge of wrong. Hast thou forgot, ungrateful as thou art, Who saved thy father with a friendly part? Lawless he ravaged with his martial powers The Taphian pirates on Thesprotia's shores; Enraged, his life, his treasures they demand; Ulysses saved him from the avenger's hand.</p></div> </div>
