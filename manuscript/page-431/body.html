<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The barren trees of Proserpine's black woods, Poplars and willows trembling o'er the floods: There fix thy vessel in the lonely bay, And enter there the kingdoms void of day, Where Phlegethon's loud torrents, rushing down, Hiss in the flaming gulf of Acheron; And where, slow rolling from the Stygian bed, Cocytus' lamentable waters spread: Where the dark rock o'erhangs the infernal lake, And mingling streams eternal murmurs make. First draw thy falchion, and on every side Trench the black earth a cubit long and wide: To all the shades around libations pour, And o'er the ingredients strew the hallow'd flour: New wine and milk, with honey temper'd bring, And living water from the crystal spring. Then the wan shades and feeble ghosts implore, With promised offerings on thy native shore; A barren cow, the stateliest of the isle, And heap'd with various wealth, a blazing pile: These to the rest;</p></div> </div>
