Again the restless orb his toil renews, Dust mounts in clouds, and sweat descends in dews.</p><p>"Now I the strength of Hercules behold, A towering spectre of gigantic mould, A shadowy form! for high in heaven's abodes Himself resides, a god among the gods; There in the bright assemblies of the skies. He nectar quaffs, and Hebe crowns his joys.
