<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"There with soft step the fair Alcmena trod, Who bore Alcides to the thundering god: And Megara, who charm'd the son of Jove, And soften'd his stern soul to tender love.</p><p>"Sullen and sour, with discontented mien, Jocasta frown'd, the incestuous Theban queen; With her own son she join'd in nuptial bands, Though father's blood imbrued his murderous hands The gods and men the dire offence detest, The gods with all their furies rend his breast; In lofty Thebes he wore the imperial crown, A pompous wretch! accursed upon a throne. The wife self-murder'd from a beam depends, And her foul soul to blackest hell descends; Thence to her son the choicest plagues she brings, And the fiends haunt him with a thousand stings.</p></div> </div>
