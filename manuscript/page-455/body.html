<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>horrid Laestrygons, the men of blood. Presaging tears apace began to rain; But tears in mortal miseries are vain. In equal parts I straight divide my band, And name a chief each party to command; I led the one, and of the other side Appointed brave Eurylochus the guide. Then in the brazen helm the lots we throw, And fortune casts Eurylochus to go; He march'd with twice eleven in his train; Pensive they march, and pensive we remain.</p><p>"The palace in a woody vale they found, High raised of stone; a shaded space around; Where mountain wolves and brindled lions roam, (By magic tamed,) familiar to the dome. With gentle blandishment our men they meet, And wag their tails, and fawning lick their feet.</p></div> </div>
