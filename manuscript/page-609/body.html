But in my absence riot fills the place, Nor bears the modest queen a stranger's face; From noiseful revel far remote she flies, But rarely seen, or seen with weeping eyes. No--let Eurymachus receive my guest, Of nature courteous, and by far the best; He woos the queen with more respectful flame, And emulates her former husband's fame, With what success, 'tis Jove's alone to know, And the hoped nuptials turn to joy or woe."</p><p>Thus speaking, on the right up-soar'd in air The hawk, Apollo's swift-wing'd messenger: His dreadful pounces tore a trembling dove; The clotted feathers, scatter'd from above, Between the hero and the vessel pour Thick plumage mingled with a sanguine shower.</p></div> </div>
