<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Pirates and conquerors of harden'd mind, The foes of peace, and scourges of mankind, To whom offending men are made a prey When Jove in vengeance gives a land away; E'en these, when of their ill-got spoils possess'd, Find sure tormentors in the guilty breast: Some voice of God close whispering from within, 'Wretch! this is villainy, and this is sin.' But these, no doubt, some oracle explore, That tells, the great Ulysses is no more. Hence springs their confidence, and from our sighs Their rapine strengthens, and their riots rise: Constant as Jove the night and day bestows, Bleeds a whole hecatomb, a vintage flows. None match'd this hero's wealth, of all who reign O'er the fair islands of the neighbouring main.</p></div> </div>
