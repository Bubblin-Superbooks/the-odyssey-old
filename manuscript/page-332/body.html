Incensed, Ulysses with a frown replies: "O forward to proclaim thy soul unwise! With partial hands the gods their gifts dispense; Some greatly think, some speak with manly sense; Here Heaven an elegance of form denies, But wisdom the defect of form supplies; This man with energy of thought controls, And steals with modest violence our souls; He speaks reservedly, but he speaks with force, Nor can one word be changed but for a worse; In public more than mortal he appears, And as he moves, the praising crowd reveres;</p></div> </div>
