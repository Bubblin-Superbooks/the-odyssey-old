Minerva comforts him, and casts him asleep. At his waking he desires a favourable sign from Jupiter, which is granted. The feast of Apollo is celebrated by the people, and the suitors banquet in the palace. Telemachus exerts his authority amongst them; notwithstanding which, Ulysses is insulted by Caesippus, and the rest continue in their excesses. Strange prodigies are seen by Theoclymenus, the augur, who explains them to the destruction of the wooers.</p><p>An ample hide devine Ulysses spread. And form'd of fleecy skins his humble bed (The remnants of the spoil the suitor-crowd In festival devour'd, and victims vow'd).</p></div> </div>
