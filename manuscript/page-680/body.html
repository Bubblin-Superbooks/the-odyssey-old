For men like these on earth he shall not find In all the miscreant race of human kind." Thus she. Eumaeus all her words attends, And, parting, to the suitor powers descends; There seeks Telemachus, and thus apart In whispers breathes the fondness of his heart:</p><p>"The time, my lord, invites me to repair Hence to the lodge; my charge demands my care. These sons of murder thirst thy life to take; O guard it, guard it, for thy servant's sake!"</p><p>"Thanks to my friend (he cries): but now the hour Of night draws on, go seek the rural bower: But first refresh: and at the dawn of day Hither a victim to the gods convey. Our life to Heaven's immortal powers we trust, Safe in their care, for Heaven protects the just."</p></div> </div>
