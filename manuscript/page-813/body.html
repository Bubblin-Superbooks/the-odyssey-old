<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Thus spoke the king: the observant train obey, At once they bathe, and dress in proud array: The lyrist strikes the string; gay youths advance, And fair-zoned damsels form the sprightly dance. The voice, attuned to instrumental sounds, Ascends the roof, the vaulted roof rebounds; Not unobserved: the Greeks eluded say, "Lo! the queen weds, we hear the spousal lay! Inconstant! to admit the bridal hour." Thus they--but nobly chaste she weds no more.</p><p>Meanwhile the wearied king the bath ascends; With faithful cares Eurynome attends, O'er every limb a shower of fragrance sheds; Then, dress'd in pomp, magnificent he treads. The warrior-goddess gives his frame to shine With majesty enlarged, and grace divine. Back from his brows in wavy ringlets fly His thick large locks of hyacinthine dye.</p></div> </div>
